855056,2017-08-28 15:14:00-05,Forward osmosis,"'''Forward osmosis''' ('''FO''') is an [[osmosis|osmotic]] process that, like [[reverse osmosis]] (RO), uses a [[semi-permeable membrane]] to effect [[Separation process|separation]] of [[water]] from dissolved solutes. The driving force for this separation is an [[osmotic pressure]] gradient, such that a ""draw"" [[solution]] of high [[concentration]] (relative to that of the feed solution), is used to induce a net flow of water through the membrane into the draw solution, thus effectively separating the feed water from its solutes. In contrast, the reverse osmosis process uses hydraulic [[pressure]] as the driving force for separation, which serves to counteract the osmotic pressure gradient that would otherwise favor water flux from the permeate to the feed.  Hence significantly more energy is required for reverse osmosis compared to forward osmosis.

[[File:Osmotic membrane processes.jpg|thumb|Family of osmotic membrane processes, including reverse osmosis and forward osmosis]]The simplest equation describing the relationship between osmotic and hydraulic pressures and water (solvent) flux is:

<center><math>J_w = A \left(\Delta \pi - \Delta P \right)</math></center>

where <math>J_w</math> is water [[flux]], A is the [[hydraulic permeability]] of the membrane, Δπ is the difference in osmotic pressures on the two sides of the membrane, and ΔP is the difference in [[hydrostatic pressure]] (negative values of <math>J_w</math> indicating reverse osmotic flow). The modeling of these relationships is in practice more complex than this equation indicates, with flux depending on the membrane, feed, and draw solution characteristics, as well as the [[fluid dynamics]] within the process itself.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Membranes for power-generation by pressure-retarded osmosis|doi=10.1016/S0376-7388(00)82088-8|year=1981|last1=Lee|first1=K|journal=Journal of Membrane Science|volume=8|issue=2|pages=141–171 }}</ref>

The solute flux (<math>J_s</math>) for each individual solute can be modelled by [[Fick's laws of diffusion|Fick’s Law]]

<center><math>J_s = B \Delta c </math></center>

Where <math>B</math> is the solute permeability coefficient and <math>\Delta c</math> is the trans-membrane concentration differential for the solute. It is clear from this governing equation that a solute will diffuse from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. This is well known in reverse osmosis where solutes from the feedwater diffuse to the product water, however in the case of forward osmosis the situation can be far more complicated.

In FO processes we may have solute diffusion in both directions depending on the composition of the draw solution and the feed water. This does two things; the draw solution solutes may diffuse to the feed solution and the feed solution solutes may diffuse to the draw solution. Clearly these phenomena have consequences in terms of the selection of the draw solution for any particular FO process. For instance the loss of draw solution may affect the feed solution perhaps due to environmental issues or contamination of the feed stream, such as in osmotic membrane bioreactors.

An additional distinction between the reverse osmosis (RO) and forward osmosis (FO) processes is that the permeate water resulting from an RO process is in most cases fresh water ready for use. In the FO process, this is not the case. The membrane separation of the FO process in effect results in a ""trade"" between the solutes of the feed solution and the draw solution. Depending on the concentration of solutes in the feed (which dictates the necessary concentration of solutes in the draw) and the intended use of the product of the FO process, this step may be all that is required.

The forward osmosis process is also known as osmosis or in the case of a number of companies who have coined their own terminology 'engineered osmosis' and 'manipulated osmosis'.

==Applications==

===Emergency drinks===
[[File:Osmotic hydration bag.jpg|100px|thumbnail|Hydration bag before use]]
One example of an application of this type may be found in ""hydration bags"", which use an ingestible draw solute and are intended for separation of water from [[Concentration#Qualitative description|dilute]] feeds. This allows, for example, the ingestion of water from surface waters (streams, ponds, puddles, etc.) that may be expected to contain [[pathogen]]s or [[toxicity|toxins]] that are readily rejected by the FO membrane. With sufficient contact time, such water will permeate the membrane bag into the draw solution, leaving the undesirable feed constituents behind. The diluted draw solution may then be ingested directly. Typically, the draw solutes are sugars such as [[glucose]] or [[fructose]], which provide the additional benefit of nutrition to the user of the FO device. A point of additional interest with such bags is that they may be readily used to recycle [[urine]], greatly extending the ability of a backpacker or soldier to survive in arid environments.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.wcponline.com/pdf/Salter.pdf|author=Salter, R.J.|title= Forward Osmosis|journal= Water Conditioning and Purification |volume=48|issue=4|year=2005|pages=36–38}}</ref> This process may also, in principle, be employed with highly concentrated saline feedwater sources such as seawater, as one of the first intended uses of FO with ingestible solutes was for survival in life rafts at sea.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0011-9164(00)84119-3|title=Drinking water from sea water by forward osmosis|year=1976|last1=Kessler|first1=J.O.|last2=Moody|first2=C.D.|journal=Desalination|volume=18|issue=3|pages=297–306}}</ref>

===Desalination===
[[File:Modern Water FO Plant Al Khaluf Oman.jpg|thumb|Modern Water's containerised forward osmosis desalination plant at Al Khaluf, Oman]]
Desalinated water can be produced from the diluted draw / osmotic agent solution, using a second process.  This may be by membrane separation, thermal method, physical separation or a combination of these processes.  The process has the feature of inherently low [[fouling]] because of the forward osmosis first step, unlike conventional reverse osmosis desalination plants where fouling is often a problem. [[Modern Water]] has deployed forward osmosis based desalination plants in Gibraltar and Oman.<ref>{{cite journal|title=FO plant completes 1-year of operation|url=http://www.modernwater.com/assets/pdfs/WDR%20-%2044.pdf|accessdate= 28 May 2011|journal=Water Desalination Report|date=15 Nov 2010|pages=2–3}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Modern Water taps demand in Middle East|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/sharewatch/small-talk-modern-water-taps-demand-in-middle-east-1826064.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=23 Nov 2009}}</ref><ref>

===Evaporative cooling tower – make-up water===
[[File:Forward osmosis for evaporative cooling tower make-up.jpg|thumb|Simple diagram of forward osmosis applied to the production of make-up water for evaporative cooling]]One other application developed, where only the forward osmosis step is used, is in evaporative cooling make-up water.  In this case the cooling water is the draw solution and the water lost by evaporation is simply replaced using water produced by forward osmosis from a suitable source, such as seawater, brackish water, treated sewage effluent or industrial waste water.  Thus in comparison with other ‘[[desalination]]’ processes that may be used for make-up water the energy consumption is a fraction of these with the added advantage of the low fouling propensity of a forward osmosis process.<ref>P.

===Landfill leachate treatment===
In the case where the desired product is fresh water that does not contain draw solutes, a second separation step is required. The first separation step of FO, driven by an osmotic pressure gradient, does not require a significant energy input (only unpressurized stirring or pumping of the solutions involved). The second separation step, however does typically require energy input. One method used for the second separation step is to employ RO. This approach has been used, for instance, in the treatment of [[landfill]] [[leachate]]. An FO membrane separation is used to draw water from the leachate feed into a saline (NaCl) brine. The diluted brine is then passed through a RO process to produce fresh water and a reusable brine concentrate. The advantage of this method is not a savings in energy, but rather in the fact that the FO process is more resistant to [[fouling]] from the leachate feed than a RO process alone would be.<ref>R. J. York, R. S. Thiel and E. G. Beaudry, Full-scale experience of direct osmosis concentration applied to leachate management, Sardinia ’99 Seventh International Waste Management and Landfill Symposium, S. Margherita di Pula, Cagliari, Sardinia, Italy, 1999.</ref> A similar FO/RO hybrid has been used for the [[concentrate|concentration]] of food products, such as fruit juice.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=E. G. Beaudry |author2=K. A. Lampi |title= Membrane technology for direct osmosis concentration of fruit juices|journal= Food Technology|volume= 44 |year=1990|page=121}}</ref>

===Brine concentration===
Brine concentration using forward osmosis may be achieved using a high osmotic pressure draw solution with a means to recover and regenerate it.  One such process uses the ammonia-carbon dioxide forward osmosis process originally developed at Yale University<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.yale.edu/env/elimelech/publication-pdf/McCutcheon-McGinnis-Elimelech-DESALINATION-174(2005)1-11.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.desal.2004.11.002|title=A novel ammonia—carbon dioxide forward (direct) osmosis desalination process|year=2005|last1=McCutcheon|first1=Jeffrey R.|last2=McGinnis|first2=Robert L.|last3=Elimelech|first3=Menachem|journal=Desalination|volume=174|pages=1–11 }}</ref><ref>{{ cite patent | country = US | number = 7560029 | status = patent | title = Osmotic Desalination Process |  gdate = 2009-07-14 | inventor = Robert McGinnis}}</ref> and commercialized by Oasys Water.  Because ammonia and carbon dioxide readily dissociate into gases using heat, the draw solutes can effectively be recovered and reused in a closed loop system. Brine concentration is currently being used in the oil and gas industry to treat produced water in the Permian Basin area of Texas.<ref>Water Desalination Report, [http://www.desalination.com/wdr/48/39/fo-process-concentrates-oilfield-brine ""FO process concentrates oilfield brine""].

===Feed water 'softening' / pre-treatment for thermal desalination===
[[File:Forward osmosis based feedwater pre-treatment for multi stage flash distillation.jpg|thumb|right|Forward osmosis based feedwater pre-treatment for multi stage flash distillation]]
One unexploited application<ref>{{ cite patent | country = EP | number = 2493815 | status = patent | title = Thermal Desalination | gdate = 2013-09-25 | inventor = Peter Nicoll}}</ref> is to 'soften' or pre-treat the feedwater to [[Multi-stage flash distillation|multi stage flash]] (MSF) or [[Multiple-effect distillation|multiple effect distillation]] (MED) plants by osmotically diluting the recirculating brine with the cooling water.  This reduces the concentrations of scale forming calcium carbonate and calcium sulphate compared to the normal process, thus allowing an increase in top brine temperature (TBT), output and gained output ratio (GOR).  Darwish et al.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mohammed Darwish|last2=Ashraf Hassan|last3=Abdel Nasser Mabrouk|last4=Hassan Abdulrahim|last5=Adel Sharif|title=Viability of integrating forward osmosis (FO) as pretreatment for existing desalting plant|journal=Desalination and Water Treatment|date=10 July 2015|doi=10.1080/19443994.2015.1066270}}</ref> showed that the TBT could be raised from 110&nbsp;°C to 135&nbsp;°C whilst maintaining the same scaling index for calcium sulphate.

===Osmotic power===
[[File:Simplistic pressure retarded osmosis power generation diagram.jpg|thumb|right|Simple PRO power generation scheme]]
In 1954 Pattle<ref>{{cite journal|last=R.E. Pattle|title=Production of electric power by mixing fresh and salt water in the hydroelectric pile|journal=Nature|date=2 October 1954|volume=174|page=660|doi=10.1038/174660a0|issue=4431}}</ref> suggested that there was an untapped source of power when a river mixes with the sea, in terms of the lost osmotic pressure, however it was not until the mid ‘70s where a practical method of exploiting it using selectively permeable membranes by Loeb <ref>{{cite journal|last=S. Loeb|title=Osmotic power plants|journal=Science|date=22 August 1975|volume=189|issue=4203|pages=654–655|doi=10.1126/science.189.4203.654|pmid=17838753}}</ref> and independently by Jellinek<ref>{{cite journal|last=H.H.G.  Jellinek|title=Osmotic work I. Energy production from osmosis on fresh water/saline water systems|journal=Kagaku Kojo|date=1975|volume=19}}</ref> was outlined.  This process was referred by Loeb as pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) and one simplistic implementation is shown opposite.  Some situations that may be envisaged to exploit it are using the differential osmotic pressure between a low brackish river flowing into the sea, or brine and seawater.  The worldwide theoretical potential for osmotic power has been estimated at 1,650 TWh / year.<ref>{{cite journal |author=O.S. Scramesto |author2=S.-E. Skillhagen |author3=W.K.

In more recent times a significant amount of research and development work has been undertaken and funded by Statkraft, the Norwegian state energy company.

==Research==
An area of current research in FO involves direct removal of draw solutes, in this case by means of a magnetic field. Small (nanoscale) magnetic particles are suspended in solution creating osmotic pressures sufficient for the separation of water from a dilute feed. Once the draw solution containing these particles has been diluted by the FO water flux, they may be separated from that solution by use of a magnet (either against the side of a hydration bag, or around a pipe in-line in a steady state process).","==References==

7906908,2017-08-28 00:00:00-05,Biomass,"'''Biomass''' is an industry term for getting energy by burning wood, and other [[organic matter]]. Burning biomass releases carbon emissions, but has been classed as a renewable energy source in the [[EU]] and [[UN]] legal frameworks, because plant stocks can be replaced with new growth.<ref>See M Le Page, ‘The Great Carbon Scam’ (21 September 2016) [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23130922-600-revealed-the-renewable-energy-scam-making-global-warming-worse/ 231 New Scientist 20–21]</ref> Also, since the plants build themselves using carbon dioxide and release oxygen as they grow, the net balance of the carbon dioxide after the matter has burned is zero, meaning no extra carbon dioxide is added to the atmosphere. It has become popular among coal power stations, which switch from coal to biomass in order to convert to renewable energy generation without wasting existing generating plant and infrastructure. Biomass most often refers to plants or plant-based materials that are not used for food or feed, and are specifically called [[lignocellulosic biomass]].<ref name=""Biomass Energy Center"">[http://www.biomassenergycentre.org.uk/portal/page?_pageid=76,15049&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL Biomass Energy Center].

Based on the source of biomass, biofuels are classified broadly into two major categories. [[Biofuel#First-generation biofuels|First-generation biofuels]] are derived from sources such as sugarcane and [[corn]] starch. Sugars present in this biomass are fermented to produce [[bioethanol]], an alcohol fuel which can be used directly in a [[fuel cell]] to produce electricity or serve as an additive to gasoline.

Plant energy is produced by crops specifically grown for use as fuel that offer high biomass output per [[hectare]] with low input energy. Some examples of these plants are wheat, which typically yields 7.5–8 tonnes of grain per hectare, and straw, which typically yields 3.5–5 tonnes per hectare in the UK.<ref name=""Energy crops"">{{cite web|title=Energy crops|url=http://www.biomassenergycentre.org.uk/portal/page?_pageid=75,17301&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL|work=crops are grown specifically for use as fuel|publisher=BIOMASS Energy Centre|accessdate=6 April 2013}}</ref> The grain can be used for liquid transportation fuels while the straw can be burned to produce heat or electricity. Plant biomass can also be degraded from [[cellulose]] to [[glucose]] through a series of chemical treatments, and the resulting sugar can then be used as a first-generation biofuel.

The main contributors of [[waste energy]] are [[municipal solid waste]], [[manufacturing waste]], and [[landfill gas]].

Efforts are being made to identify which species of algae are most suitable for energy production. Genetic engineering approaches could also be utilized to improve microalgae as a source of biofuel.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Randor Radakovits|author2=Robert E.

The biomass used for electricity generation varies by region. Forest by-products, such as wood residues, are common in the [[United States|US]]. Agricultural waste is common in [[Mauritius]] (sugar cane residue) and [[Southeast Asia]] (rice husks). Animal husbandry residues, such as [[poultry litter]], are common in the [[UK]].<ref name=ODI1>Frauke Urban and Tom Mitchell 2011.

===Thermal conversions===
[[File:Top 5 Biomass-Electricity Countries.png|thumb|Trends in the top five countries generating electricity from biomass]]
Thermal conversion processes use heat as the dominant mechanism to convert biomass into another chemical form. Also known as thermal oil heating, it is a type of indirect heating in which a liquid phase heat transfer medium is heated and circulated to one or more heat energy users within a closed loop system.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sigmathermal.com/biomass-energy-systems/|title=Biomass Energy Systems: Design & Service|newspaper=Sigma Thermal|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-18}}</ref> The basic alternatives of [[combustion]] ([[torrefaction]], [[pyrolysis]], and [[gasification]]) are separated principally by the extent to which the chemical reactions involved are allowed to proceed (mainly controlled by the availability of oxygen and conversion temperature).

Energy created by burning biomass is particularly suited for countries where the fuel wood grows more rapidly, e.g. tropical countries. There are a number of other less common, more experimental or proprietary thermal processes that may offer benefits such as hydrothermal upgrading (HTU) and [[hydroprocessing]]. Some have been developed for use on high moisture content biomass, including aqueous slurries, and allow them to be converted into more convenient forms. Some of the applications of thermal conversion are combined heat and power (CHP) and [[co-firing]]. In a typical dedicated biomass power plant, efficiencies range from 20–27% ([[Heat of combustion#Higher heating value|higher heating value]] basis).<ref>[http://www.claverton-energy.com/owning-and-operating-costs-of-waste-and-biomass-power-plants.html Owning and Operating Costs of Waste and Biomass Power Plants]. Claverton-energy.com (2010-09-17). Retrieved on 2012-02-28.</ref> Biomass cofiring with coal, by contrast, typically occurs at efficiencies near those of the coal combustor (30–40%, higher heating value basis).<ref>Baxter, L. (2005). ""Biomass-coal co-combustion: Opportunity for affordable renewable energy."" Fuel 84(10): 1295–1302.</ref>

===Chemical conversion===
A range of chemical processes may be used to convert biomass into other forms, such as to produce a fuel that is more conveniently used, transported or stored, or to exploit some property of the process itself. Many of these processes are based in large part on similar coal-based processes, such as [[Fischer-Tropsch synthesis]], methanol production, olefins (ethylene and propylene), and similar chemical or fuel feedstocks. In most cases, the first step involves gasification, which step generally is the most expensive and involves the greatest technical risk.<ref>Liu, G., E. D. Larson, R. H. Williams, T. G. Kreutz and X. Guo (2011). ""Making fischer-tropsch fuels and electricity from coal and biomass: Performance and cost analysis."" Energy & Fuels 25: 415–437.</ref>
Biomass is more difficult to feed into a pressure vessel than coal or any liquid. Therefore, biomass [[gasification]] is frequently done at atmospheric pressure and causes combustion of biomass to produce a combustible gas consisting of [[carbon monoxide]], [[hydrogen]], and traces of [[methane]]. This gas mixture, called a [[producer gas#USA|producer gas]], can provide fuel for various vital processes, such as [[internal combustion engines]], as well as substitute for furnace oil in direct heat applications.<ref name=""Rajvanshi, A. K. 1986"">Rajvanshi, A. K. ""Biomass Gasification."" Alternative Energy in Agriculture, Vol. II, Ed. D. Yogi Goswami, CRC Press, 1986, pp. 83–102.</ref> Because any biomass material can undergo gasification, this process is far more attractive than ethanol or biomass production, where only particular biomass materials can be used to produce a fuel. In addition, biomass gasification is a desirable process due to the ease at which it can convert solid waste (such as wastes available on a farm) into producer gas, which is a very usable fuel.<ref name=""Rajvanshi, A. K. 1986""/>

Conversion of biomass to [[biofuel]] can also be achieved via selective conversion of individual components of biomass.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kunkes|first=E. L.|author2=Simonetti, D.

Biomass also has the potential to be converted to multiple commodity chemicals. [[Halomethanes]] have successfully been by produced using a combination of A. fermentans and engineered S. cerevisiae.<ref name=""Alaimo, Peter 2010"">Alaimo, Peter & Amanda-Lynn Marshall (2010) ""Useful Products from Complex Starting Materials: Common Chemicals from Biomass Feedstocks"" Chemistry – A European Journal 15 4970–4980.</ref> This method converts NaX salts and unprocessed biomass such as [[switchgrass]], sugarcane, corn stover, or [[Populus|poplar]] into halomethanes. S-adenosylmethionine which is naturally occurring in S. cerevisiae allows a methyl group to be transferred. Production levels of 150&nbsp;mg L-1H-1 iodomethane were achieved. At these levels roughly 173000&nbsp;L of capacity would need to be operated just to replace the United States’ need for iodomethane.<ref name=""Alaimo, Peter 2010""/> However, an advantage of this method is that it uses NaI rather than I2; NaI is significantly less hazardous than I2. This method may be applied to produce ethylene in the future.

Other chemical processes such as converting straight and waste vegetable oils into biodiesel is [[transesterification]].<ref>[http://www.biomassenergycentre.org.uk/portal/page?_pageid=75,15179&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL Conversion technologies]. Biomassenergycentre.org.uk. Retrieved on 2012-02-28.</ref>

===Biochemical conversion===
As biomass is a natural material, many highly efficient biochemical processes have developed in nature to break down the molecules of which biomass is composed, and many of these biochemical conversion processes can be harnessed.

Biochemical conversion makes use of the enzymes of bacteria and other microorganisms to break down biomass into gaseous or liquid fuels, such a biogas or bioethanol.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bioenergyconsult.com/biochemical-conversion-technologies/|title=Biochemical Conversion of Biomass|date=2014-05-29|newspaper=BioEnergy Consult|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-18}}</ref> In most cases, microorganisms are used to perform the conversion process: [[anaerobic digestion]], [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]], and [[composting]].

[[Glycoside hydrolases]] are the enzymes involved in the degradation of the major fraction of biomass, such as polysaccharides present in starch and lignocellulose. Thermostable variants are gaining increasing roles as catalysts in biorefining applications in the future bioeconomy, since recalcitrant biomass often needs thermal treatment for more efficient degradation. Some examples in today´s processing include production of monosaccharides for food applications as well as use as carbon source for microbial conversion into metabolites such as bioethanol and chemical intermediates, oligocaccharide production for [[prebiotic (nutrition)]] applications and production of surfactants alkyl glycoside type.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=|year=2014|author1=Linares-Pastén|first1=J.

===Electrochemical conversion===

===In the United States===
The  biomass power generating industry in the United States consists of approximately 11,000 [[Megawatt|MW]] of summer operating capacity actively supplying power to the grid, and produces about 1.4 percent of the U.S. electricity supply.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/alternate/page/renew_energy_consump/table4.html|title=U.S. Electric Net Summer Capacity|date=July 2001|publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration|accessdate=2010-01-25}}</ref>

Public Service of New Hampshire (later merged with other companies into Eversource) in 2006 replaced a 50 MW coal boiler with a new 50 MW biomass boiler at its Schiller Station facility in Portsmouth, NH.<ref>[https://www.eversource.com/content/nh/about/news-room/new-hampshire/newspost?Group=new-hampshire&Post=northern-wood-power-celebrates-a-decade-of-clean-energy The tenth anniversary of Northern Wood Power - November 22, 2016]</ref>  The boiler's biomass fuel is from sources in NH, Massachusetts and Maine.

Currently, the New Hope Power Partnership is the largest biomass power plant in the U.S. The 140 MW facility uses sugarcane fiber ([[bagasse]]) and recycled urban wood as fuel to generate enough power for its large milling and refining operations as well as to supply electricity for nearly 60,000 homes.<ref>[http://www.ferc.gov/EventCalendar/Files/20070820160118-ER07-1070-000.pdf Agreement for Generating Balancing Service].

===Second-generation biofuels===
Second-generation biofuels were not (in 2010) produced commercially, but a considerable number of research activities were taking place mainly in North America, Europe and also in some emerging countries.

Biomass power plant size is often driven by biomass availability in close proximity as transport costs of the (bulky) fuel play a key factor in the plant's economics.

Industry professionals claim that a range of issues can affect a plant's ability to comply with emissions standards. Some of these challenges, unique to biomass plants, include inconsistent fuel supplies and age. The type and amount of the fuel supply are completely reliant factors; the fuel can be in the form of building debris or agricultural waste (such as removal of invasive species or orchard trimmings). Furthermore, many of the biomass plants are old, use outdated technology and were not built to comply with today’s stringent standards. In fact, many are based on technologies developed during the term of U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]], who created the [[United States Department of Energy]] in 1977.<ref name=""online.wsj.com""/>

The U.S. [[Energy Information Administration]] projected that by 2017, biomass is expected to be about twice as expensive as natural gas, slightly more expensive than nuclear power, and much less expensive than solar panels.<ref>{{cite report|author=U.S. Energy Information Administration|docket=National Energy Information Center|title=''Annual Energy Outlook 2010''|type=report no.

The adoption of biomass-based energy plants has been a slow but steady process. Between the years of 2002 and 2012 the production of these plants has increased 14%.<ref name=""Scheck"">{{cite news|first=Justin|last=Scheck|title=Wood-Fired Plants Generate Violations|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=July 23, 2012|url=http://www.ncpa.org/sub/dpd/index.php?Article_ID=22202|accessdate=September 27, 2012|display-authors=etal}}</ref> In the United States, alternative electricity-production sources on the whole generate about 13% of power; of this fraction, biomass contributes approximately 11% of the alternative production.<ref name=""NREL"">{{cite web|title=Learning About Renewable Energy|url=http://www.nrel.gov/learning/re_biomass.html|work=NREL's vision is to develop technology|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|accessdate=4 April 2013}}</ref> According to a study conducted in early 2012, of the 107 operating biomass plants in the United States, 85 have been cited by federal or state regulators for the violation of clean air or water standards laws over the past 5 years. This data also includes minor infractions.<ref name=""Scheck""/>

Despite harvesting, biomass crops may [[Carbon sequestration|sequester]] carbon. For example, soil organic carbon has been observed to be greater in switchgrass stands than in cultivated cropland soil, especially at depths below {{convert|30|cm|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/Publications.htm?seq_no_115=164741, Soil Carbon under Switchgrass Stands and Cultivated Cropland (Interpretive Summary and Technical Abstract)]. USDA Agricultural Research Service, April 1, 2005</ref> The grass sequesters the carbon in its increased root biomass. Typically, perennial crops sequester much more carbon than annual crops due to much greater non-harvested living biomass, both living and dead, built up over years, and much less soil disruption in cultivation.

The proposal that biomass is [[carbon-neutral fuel|carbon-neutral]] put forward in the early 1990s has been superseded by more recent science that recognizes that mature, intact forests sequester carbon more effectively than cut-over areas. When a tree's carbon is released into the atmosphere in a single pulse, it contributes to climate change much more than woodland timber rotting slowly over decades. Current studies indicate that ""even after 50 years the forest has not recovered to its initial carbon storage"" and ""the optimal strategy is likely to be protection of the standing forest"".<ref>[http://www.jobsandenergy.com Jobs and Energy].

Forest-based biomass has recently come under fire from a number of environmental organizations, including [[Greenpeace]] and the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]], for the harmful impacts it can have on forests and the climate. Greenpeace recently released a report entitled ""Fuelling a BioMess""<ref name= ""BioMess"">{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/canada/Global/canada/report/2011/10/ForestBiomess_Eng.pdf|title=Fuelling a BioMess|publisher=[[Greenpeace]]|date=October 2011|accessdate=2015-06-14}}</ref> which outlines their concerns around forest-based biomass. Because any part of the tree can be burned, the harvesting of trees for energy production encourages [[Logging#Whole tree logging|whole-tree harvesting]], which removes more nutrients and soil cover than regular harvesting, and can be harmful to the long-term health of the forest. In some jurisdictions, forest biomass removal is increasingly involving elements essential to functioning forest ecosystems, including standing trees, naturally disturbed forests and remains of traditional logging operations that were previously left in the forest. Environmental groups also cite recent scientific research which has found that it can take many decades for the carbon released by burning biomass to be recaptured by regrowing trees, and even longer in low productivity areas; furthermore, logging operations may disturb forest soils and cause them to release stored carbon.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} In light of the pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the short term in order to mitigate the [[effects of global warming|effects of climate change]], a number of environmental groups are opposing the large-scale use of forest biomass in energy production.<ref name= ""BioMess"" /><ref>[http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/slyutse/today_nrdc_and_our_partners.html NRDC fact sheet lays out biomass basics, campaign calls for action to tell EPA our forests aren't fuel | Sasha Lyutse's Blog | Switchboard, from NRDC].

==Supply chain issues==
With the seasonality of biomass supply and a great variability in sources, supply chains play a key role in cost-effective delivery of bioenergy. There are several potential challenges unique to bioenergy supply chains:<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.enpol.2013.11.071| title = Modeling of biomass-to-energy supply chain operations: Applications, challenges and research directions| journal = Energy Policy| volume = 67| pages = 116| year = 2014| last1 = Mafakheri | first1 = F. | last2 = Nasiri | first2 = F. }}</ref>

Technical issues
* Inefficiencies of the conversion processes
* Storage methods for seasonal availability
* Complex multi-component constituents incompatible with maximizing efficiency of single purpose use
* High water content of many biomass feedstock
* Conflicting decisions (technologies, locations, and routes)
* Complex location analysis (source points, inventory facilities, and production plants)

Logistic issues
* Seasonal availability leading to storage challenges and/or seasonally idle facilities
* Low bulk-density and/or high water content making transportation of biomass less economical
* Finite productivity per area and/or time incompatible with conventional approach to economy of scale focusing on maximizing facility size

Financial issues
* The limits for the traditional approach to economy of scale which focuses on maximizing single facility size
* Unavailability and complexity of life cycle costing data
* Lack of required transport infrastructure
* Limited flexibility or inflexibility to energy demand
* Risks associated with new technologies (insurability, performance, rate of return)
* Extended market volatilities (conflicts with alternative markets for biomass)
* Difficult or impossible to use financial hedging methods to control cost

Social issues
* Lack of participatory decision making
* Lack of public/community awareness
* Local supply chain impacts vs. global benefits
* Health and safety risks
* Extra pressure on transport sector
* Decreasing the esthetics of rural areas

Policy and regulatory issues
* Impact of fossil fuel tax on biomass transport
* Lack of incentives to create competition among bioenergy producers
* Focus on technology options and less attention to selection of biomass materials
* Lack of support for sustainable supply chain solutions

Institutional and organizational issues
* Varied ownership arrangements and priorities among supply chain parties
* Lack of supply chain standards
* Impact of organizational norms and rules on decision making and supply chain coordination
* Immaturity of change management practices in biomass supply chains","==See also==

==Food supplementation==
Algal oil is used as a source of [[fatty acid]] supplementation in food products, particularly [[milk]], as it is heavy in [[monounsaturated fat|mono-]] and [[polyunsaturated fat]]s, in particular [[eicosapentaenoic acid|EPA]] and [[docosahexaenoic acid|DHA]].

==Fuels==
Algae can be converted into various types of fuels, depending on the technique and the part of the cells used. The [[lipid]], or oily part of the algae biomass can be extracted and converted into biodiesel through a process similar to that used for any other vegetable oil, or converted in a refinery into ""drop-in"" replacements for petroleum-based fuels. Alternatively or following lipid extraction, the [[carbohydrate]] content of algae can be fermented into [[bioethanol]] or [[butanol fuel]].<ref name=""merinews"">{{cite web

As they do not have to produce structural compounds such as cellulose for leaves, stems, or roots, and because they can be grown floating in a rich nutritional medium, microalgae can have faster growth rates than terrestrial crops.

===Biobutanol===
{{Main article|Butanol fuel}}
Butanol can be made from [[algae]] or [[diatom]]s using only a solar powered [[biorefinery]].

In most gasoline engines, butanol can be used in place of gasoline with no modifications. In several tests, butanol consumption is similar to that of gasoline, and when blended with gasoline, provides better performance and corrosion resistance than that of ethanol or [[E85]].<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/air/caaac/mstrs/March2007/Wolf.pdf Wolf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030023008/http://www.epa.gov/air/caaac/mstrs/March2007/Wolf.pdf |date=30 October 2008 }}</ref>

In February 2010, the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] announced that the U.S. military was about to begin large-scale oil production from algal ponds into jet fuel. After extraction at a cost of $2 per gallon, the oil will be refined at less than $3 a gallon. A larger-scale refining operation, producing 50 million gallons a year, is expected to go into production in 2013, with the possibility of lower per gallon costs so that algae-based fuel would be competitive with fossil fuels. The projects, run by the companies [[Science Applications International Corporation|SAIC]] and [[General Atomics]], are expected to produce 1,000 gallons of oil per acre per year from algal ponds.<ref>{{cite news |title= Algae to solve the Pentagon's jet fuel problem |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/feb/13/algae-solve-pentagon-fuel-problem |work=The Guardian |author=Suzanne Goldenberg |date=13 February 2010 | location=London}}</ref>

== Species ==
Research into algae for the mass-production of oil focuses mainly on [[microalgae]] (organisms capable of photosynthesis that are less than 0.4&nbsp;mm in diameter, including the [[diatoms]] and [[cyanobacteria]]) as opposed to macroalgae, such as [[seaweed]]. The preference for microalgae has come about due largely to their less complex structure, fast growth rates, and high oil-content (for some species). However, some research is being done into using seaweeds for biofuels, probably due to the high availability of this resource.<ref name=""Times Online"">

== Algae nutrients and growth inputs ==
Light is what algae primarily needs for growth as it is the most limiting factor. Many companies are investing for developing systems and technologies for providing artificial light. One of them is OriginOil that has developed a Helix BioReactorTM that features a rotating vertical shaft with low-energy lights arranged in a helix pattern.<ref name="":2"">{{Cite web|url=https://lawofalgae.wiki.zoho.com/Chapter-1----Introduction-to-Algae-Biofuels.html|title=Chapter 1 - Introduction to Algae Biofuels - Selecting Algae Species, Algae Production Issues, Harvesting Algae and Extracting Oil, and Converting Algae Oil to Biofuels|website=lawofalgae.wiki.zoho.com|access-date=2016-11-16}}</ref> Water temperature also influences the metabolic and reproductive rates of algae. Although most algae species grow at low rate when the water temperature gets lower, the biomass of algal communities can get large due to the absence of grazing organisms.<ref name="":2"" /> The modest increases in water current velocity may also affect rates of algae growth since the rate of nutrient uptake and boundary layer diffusion increases with current velocity.<ref name="":2"" />

Other than light and water, phosphorus, nitrogen, and certain micronutrients are also useful and essential in growing algae. Nitrogen and phosphorus are the two most significant nutrients required for algal productivity, but other nutrients such as carbon and silica are additionally required.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.krisweb.com/krissheepscot/krisdb/html/krisweb/stream/nutrients.htm|title=Nutrients and Algae|website=www.krisweb.com|access-date=2016-11-16}}</ref> Of the nutrients required, phosphorus is one of the most essential ones as it is used in numerous metabolic processes.

There are two enrichment media that have been extensively used to grow most of the algae species: Walne medium and the Guillard's F/<sub>2</sub> medium.<ref name="":4"">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/W3732E/w3732e06.htm|title=2.3.

However, due to their complexity in the process of generation and high cost, they are not used for large-scale culture operations.<ref name="":4"" /> Therefore, enrichment media used for mass production of algae contain only the most important nutrients with agriculture-grade fertilizers rather than laboratory-grade fertilizers.<ref name="":4"" />

For reasons of economy, some experts think that algae farming for biofuels will have to be done as part of [[cogeneration]], where it can make use of waste heat and help soak up pollution.<ref name=""Worldwatch"" /><ref name=""Pond""/>

===Photobioreactors===
Most companies pursuing algae as a source of biofuels pump [[nutrient]]-rich water through plastic or borosilicate glass tubes (called ""[[bioreactor]]s"" ) that are exposed to sunlight (and so-called [[photobioreactor]]s or PBR).

Running a PBR is more difficult than using an open pond, and costlier, but may provide a higher level of control and productivity.<ref name=""Chisti, Y. 2007, pp. 294""/>  In addition, a photobioreactor can be integrated into a closed loop cogeneration system much more easily than ponds or other methods.

===Open pond===
[[File:Microalgenkwekerij te Heure bij Borculo.jpg|thumb|Raceway pond used for the cultivation of microalgae]]
Open-pond systems for the most part have been given up for the cultivation of algae with especially high oil content.<ref>
Briggs, Michael. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070416113418/http://www.unh.edu/p2/biodiesel/article_alge.html UNH Biodiesel Group (2004)]. Retrieved 26 May 2004.</ref>
Many{{who|date=September 2012}} believe that a major flaw of the [[Aquatic Species Program]] was the decision to focus their efforts exclusively on open-ponds; this makes the entire effort dependent upon the hardiness of the strain chosen, requiring it to be unnecessarily resilient in order to withstand wide swings in temperature and pH, and competition from invasive algae and bacteria. Open systems using a monoculture are also vulnerable to viral infection. The energy that a high-oil strain invests into the production of oil is energy that is not invested into the production of proteins or carbohydrates, usually resulting in the species being less hardy, or having a slower growth rate. Algal species with a lower oil content, not having to divert their energies away from growth, can be grown more effectively in the harsher conditions of an open system.<ref name=""Chisti, Y. 2007, pp. 294""/>

===Algal turf scrubber===
[[File:ATSHydromentia.jpg|thumbnail|right|2.5 acre ATS system, installed by Hydromentia on a farm creek in Florida]]
The algal turf scrubber (ATS) is a system designed primarily for cleaning nutrients and pollutants out of water using algal turfs.  ATS mimics the algal turfs of a natural coral reef by taking in nutrient rich water from waste streams or natural water sources, and pulsing it over a sloped surface.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.algalturfscrubber.com/|title=:: The Algal Turf Scrubber ::|publisher=}}</ref>  This surface is coated with a rough plastic membrane or a screen, which allows naturally occurring algal spores to settle and colonize the surface.  Once the algae has been established, it can be harvested every 5–15 days,<ref>{{cite conference | url=http://www.physicsegypt.org/epc08/epc823.pdf | title=Algal Turf Scrubbers: Cleaning Water while Capturing Solar Energy for Bio fuel Production | date=2008 | accessdate=November 4, 2016 | author=Jeffrey Bannon, J.|author2=Adey, W. | pages=19–23 | conference=Proceedings of the Fourth Environmental Physics Conference (EPC'10)}}</ref> and can produce 18 metric tons of algal biomass per hectare per year.<ref name=""bioscience.oxfordjournals.org"">{{cite journal|url=http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/61/6/434|title=Algal Turf Scrubbing: Cleaning Surface Waters with Solar Energy while Producing a Biofuel|first1=Walter H.|last1=Adey|first2=Patrick C.|last2=Kangas|first3=Walter|last3=Mulbry|date=1 June 2011|publisher=|journal=BioScience|volume=61|issue=6|pages=434–441|via=bioscience.oxfordjournals.org|doi=10.1525/bio.2011.61.6.5}}</ref>  In contrast to other methods, which focus primarily on a single high yielding species of algae, this method focuses on naturally occurring polycultures of algae.  As such, the lipid content of the algae in an ATS system is usually lower, which makes it more suitable for a fermented fuel product, such as ethanol, methane, or butanol.<ref name=""bioscience.oxfordjournals.org""/>  Conversely, the harvested algae could be treated with a [[hydrothermal liquefaction]] process, which would make possible biodiesel, gasoline, and jet fuel production.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-22314.pdf | title=Whole Algae Hydrothermal Liquefaction Technology Pathway | publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory | accessdate=November 4, 2016 | author=Mary Biddy |author2=Ryan Davis|author3=Susanne Jones|author4=Yunhua Zhu}}</ref>

There are three major advantages of ATS over other systems. The first advantage is documented higher productivity over open pond systems.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hydromentia.com/End-Products/NREL-Biodiesel-Algae-1998.pdf | title=A Look Back at the U.S. Department of Energy's Aquatic Species Program: Biodiesel from Algae | publisher=U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Fuels Development | date=July 1998 | accessdate=November 4, 2016 | author=John Sheehan|author2=Terri Dunahay|author3=John Benemann|author4=Paul Roessler}}</ref>  The second is lower operating and fuel production costs.  The third is the elimination of contamination issues due to the reliance on naturally occurring algae species.  The projected costs for energy production in an ATS system are $0.75/kg, compared to a photobioreactor which would cost $3.50/kg.<ref name=""bioscience.oxfordjournals.org""/>  Furthermore, due to the fact that the primary purpose of ATS is removing nutrients and pollutants out of water, and these costs have been shown to be lower than other methods of nutrient removal, this may incentivize the use of this technology for nutrient removal as the primary function, with biofuel production as an added benefit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hydromentia.com/Products-Services/Algal-Turf-Scrubber/Features-Benefits/Cost-Effective.html|title=Cost Effective - Hydromentia : Hydromentia|publisher=}}</ref>[[File:Algae ATS harvest.jpg|thumb|Algae being harvested and dried from an ATS system]]

==Fuel production==
After harvesting the algae, the biomass is typically processed in a series of steps, which can differ based on the species and desired product; this is an active area of research<ref name=""Chisti, Y. 2007, pp. 294""/> and also is the bottleneck of this technology: the cost of extraction is higher than those obtained. One of the solutions is to use filter feeders to ""eat"" them. Improved animals can provide both foods and fuels. An alternative method to extract the algae is to grow the algae with specific types of fungi. This causes bio-flocculation of the algae which allows for easier extraction.<ref name=""MackayGomes2015"">{{cite journal|last1=Mackay|first1=S.|last2=Gomes|first2=E.|last3=Holliger|first3=C.|last4=Bauer|first4=R.|last5=Schwitzguébel|first5=J.-P.|title=Harvesting of Chlorella sorokiniana by co-culture with the filamentous fungus Isaria fumosorosea: A potential sustainable feedstock for hydrothermal gasification|journal=Bioresource Technology|volume=185|year=2015|pages=353–361|issn=0960-8524|doi=10.1016/j.biortech.2015.03.026}}</ref>

===Dehydration===
Often, the algae is dehydrated, and then a solvent such as hexane is used to extract energy-rich compounds like [[triglyceride]]s from the dried material.<ref name=""doi10.1016/j.copbio.2010.03.005""/> Then, the extracted compounds can be processed into fuel using standard industrial procedures. For example, the extracted triglycerides are reacted with methanol to create biodiesel via [[transesterification]].<ref name=""doi10.1016/j.copbio.2010.03.005""/> The unique composition of fatty acids of each species influences the quality of the resulting biodiesel and thus must be taken into account when selecting algal species for feedstock.<ref name=""Chisti, Y. 2007, pp. 294""/>

===Hydrothermal liquefaction===
An alternative approach called [[Hydrothermal liquefaction]] employs a continuous process that subjects harvested wet algae to high temperatures and pressures&mdash;{{convert|350|C|F}} and {{convert|3000|psi}}.<ref name=giz1312>{{cite web

==Nutrients==
{{Main article|Algal nutrient solutions}}
Nutrients like [[nitrogen]] (N), [[phosphorus]] (P), and [[potassium]] (K), are important for plant growth and are essential parts of fertilizer. [[Silica]] and iron, as well as several trace elements, may also be considered important marine nutrients as the lack of one can limit the growth of, or productivity in, an area.<ref>{{cite web

===Carbon dioxide===
Bubbling {{chem|CO|2}} through algal cultivation systems can greatly increase productivity and yield (up to a saturation point). Typically, about 1.8 tonnes of [[CO2|{{chem|CO|2}}]] will be utilised per tonne of algal biomass (dry) produced, though this varies with algae species.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/accelerating-uptake-ccs-industrial-use-captured-carbon-dioxide/online/28426#c25|title=Accelerating the uptake of CCS: Industrial use of captured carbon dioxide|publisher=Global CCS Institute|accessdate=25 February 2012}}</ref> The Glenturret Distillery in [[Perthshire]], UK – home to [[The Famous Grouse]] Whisky – percolate [[CO2|{{chem|CO|2}}]] made during the whisky distillation through a microalgae bioreactor.

===Nitrogen===
Nitrogen is a valuable substrate that can be utilized in algal growth. Various sources of nitrogen can be used as a nutrient for algae, with varying capacities. Nitrate was found to be the preferred source of nitrogen, in regards to amount of biomass grown. Urea is a readily available source that shows comparable results, making it an economical substitute for nitrogen source in large scale culturing of algae.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Arumugam | first1 = M. | last2 = Agarwal | first2 = A. | last3 = Arya | first3 = M.

It is vital for the lipid content in algal cells to be of high enough quantity, while maintaining adequate cell division times, so parameters that can maximize both are under investigation.

===Wastewater===
{{Main article|Wastewater treatment facility}}
A possible nutrient source is [[waste water]] from the treatment of sewage, agricultural, or flood plain run-off, all currently major pollutants and health risks. However, this waste water cannot feed algae directly and must first be processed by bacteria, through [[anaerobic digestion]]. If waste water is not processed before it reaches the algae, it will contaminate the algae in the reactor, and at the very least, kill much of the desired algae strain. In [[biogas]] facilities, organic waste is often converted to a mixture of carbon dioxide, [[methane]], and organic fertilizer. Organic fertilizer that comes out of the digester is liquid, and nearly suitable for algae growth, but it must first be cleaned and sterilized.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.biortech.2010.06.035| pmid = 20594826| title = The potential of sustainable algal biofuel production using wastewater resources| journal = Bioresource Technology| volume = 102| issue = 1| pages = 17–25| year = 2011| last1 = Pittman | first1 = J. K. | last2 = Dean | first2 = A. P. | last3 = Osundeko | first3 = O. }}</ref>

The utilization of wastewater and ocean water instead of freshwater is strongly advocated due to the continuing depletion of freshwater resources. However, heavy metals, trace metals, and other contaminants in wastewater can decrease the ability of cells to produce lipids biosynthetically and also impact various other workings in the machinery of cells. The same is true for ocean water, but the contaminants are found in different concentrations. Thus, agricultural-grade fertilizer is the preferred source of nutrients, but heavy metals are again a problem, especially for strains of algae that are susceptible to these metals. In open pond systems the use of strains of algae that can deal with high concentrations of heavy metals could prevent other organisms from infesting these systems.<ref name=""doi10.1007/s12155-008-9008-8""/> In some instances it has even been shown that strains of algae can remove over 90% of nickel and zinc from industrial wastewater in relatively short periods of time.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0045-6535(99)00418-X| pmid = 10819208| title = Performance of different microalgal species in removing nickel and zinc from industrial wastewater| journal = Chemosphere| volume = 41| issue = 1–2| pages = 251–7| year = 2000| last1 = Chong | first1 = A.

One of the main advantages that using microalgae as the feedstock when compared to more traditional crops is that it can be grown much more easily.<ref name=""Demirbas, A. 2011"">{{Cite journal | last1 = Demirbas | first1 = A. | last2 = Fatih Demirbas | first2 = M. | doi = 10.1016/j.enconman.2010.06.055 | title = Importance of algae oil as a source of biodiesel | journal = Energy Conversion and Management | volume = 52 | pages = 163–170 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref> Algae can be grown in land that would not be considered suitable for the growth of the regularly used crops.<ref name=""Mata, T.M. 2009""/> In addition to this, wastewater that would normally hinder plant growth has been shown to be very effective in growing algae.<ref name=""Demirbas, A. 2011""/> Because of this, algae can be grown without taking up arable land that would otherwise be used for producing food crops, and the better resources can be reserved for normal crop production. Microalgae also require fewer resources to grow and little attention is needed, allowing the growth and cultivation of algae to be a very passive process.<ref name=""Mata, T.M. 2009""/>

===Impact on food===
Many traditional feedstocks for biodiesel, such as corn and palm, are also used as feed for livestock on farms, as well as a valuable source of food for humans. Because of this, using them as biofuel reduces the amount of food available for both, resulting in an increased cost for both the food and the fuel produced. Using algae as a source of biodiesel can alleviate this problem in a number of ways. First, algae is not used as a primary food source for humans, meaning that it can be used solely for fuel and there would be little impact in the food industry.<ref name=""Vasudevan, P.T. 2008"">{{Cite journal | last1 = Vasudevan | first1 = P. T. | last2 = Briggs | first2 = M. | doi = 10.1007/s10295-008-0312-2 | title = Biodiesel production—current state of the art and challenges | journal = Journal of Industrial Microbiology & Biotechnology | volume = 35 | issue = 5 | pages = 421–430 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref> Second, many of the waste-product extracts produced during the processing of algae for biofuel can be used as a sufficient animal feed. This is an effective way to minimize waste and a much cheaper alternative to the more traditional corn- or grain-based feeds.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Demirbaş | first1 = A. | title = Production of Biodiesel from Algae Oils | doi = 10.1080/15567030701521775 | journal = Energy Sources, Part A: Recovery, Utilization, and Environmental Effects | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | pages = 163–168 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref>

===Minimization of waste===
Growing algae as a source of biofuel has also been shown to have numerous environmental benefits, and has presented itself as a much more environmentally friendly alternative to current biofuels. For one, it is able to utilize run-off, water contaminated with fertilizers and other nutrients that are a by-product of farming, as its primary source of water and nutrients.<ref name=""Demirbas, A. 2011""/> Because of this, it prevents this contaminated water from mixing with the lakes and rivers that currently supply our drinking water. In addition to this, the ammonia, nitrates, and phosphates that would normally render the water unsafe actually serve as excellent nutrients for the algae, meaning that fewer resources are needed to grow the algae.<ref name=""Mata, T.M. 2009""/> Many algae species used in biodiesel production are excellent bio-fixers, meaning they are able to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to use as a form of energy for themselves. Because of this, they have found use in industry as a way to treat flue gases and reduce GHG emissions.<ref name=""Mata, T.M. 2009""/>

==Disadvantages==

===Commercial Viability===
Algae biodiesel is still a fairly new technology. Despite the fact that research began over 30 years ago, it was put on hold during the mid-1990s, mainly due to a lack of funding and a relatively low petroleum cost.<ref name=""Pienko, P.T. 2009"">{{Cite journal | last1 = Pienkos | first1 = P. T. | last2 = Darzins | first2 = A. | doi = 10.1002/bbb.159 | title = The promise and challenges of microalgal-derived biofuels | journal = Biofuels, Bioproducts and Biorefining | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 431–440 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref> For the next few years algae biofuels saw little attention; it was not until the gas peak of the early 2000s that it eventually had a revitalization in the search for alternative fuel sources.<ref name=""Pienko, P.T. 2009""/> While the technology exists to harvest and convert algae into a usable source of biodiesel, it still hasn't been implemented into a large enough scale to support the current energy needs. Further research will be required to make the production of algae biofuels more efficient, and at this point it is currently being held back by lobbyists in support of alternative biofuels, like those produced from corn and grain.<ref name=""Pienko, P.T. 2009""/> In 2013, [[Exxon Mobil]] Chairman and CEO [[Rex Tillerson]] said that after originally committing to spending up to $600 million on development in a joint venture with [[J. Craig Venter]]'s [[Synthetic Genomics]], algae is ""probably further"" than ""25 years away"" from commercial viability,<ref name=""Tillerson"">[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-08/exxon-at-least-25-years-away-from-making-fuel-from-algae.html ""Exxon at Least 25 Years Away From Making Fuel From Algae""] ''Bloomberg'', 8 March 2013</ref> although [[Solazyme]]<ref name=""Erin Voegele""/> and [[Sapphire Energy]]<ref name=""Andrew Herndon""/> already began small-scale commercial sales in 2012 and 2013, respectively. By 2017, most efforts had been abandoned or changed to other applications, with only a few remaining.<ref name=""Eric Wesoff""/>

===Stability===
The biodiesel produced from the processing of microalgae differs from other forms of biodiesel in the content of polyunsaturated fats.<ref name=""Demirbas, A. 2011""/> Polyunsaturated fats are known for their ability to retain fluidity at lower temperatures. While this may seem like an advantage in production during the colder temperatures of the winter, the polyunsaturated fats result in lower stability during regular seasonal temperatures.<ref name=""Vasudevan, P.T. 2008""/>

===Genetic engineering===
[[Genetic engineering]] algae has been used to increase lipid production or growth rates. Current research in genetic engineering includes either the introduction or removal of [[enzyme]]s.

Geraniol is a primary component in [[rose oil]], [[palmarosa oil]], and [[citronella oil]] as well as essential oils, making it a viable source of [[triacylglyceride]]s for biodiesel production.<ref>Geraniol, The Merck Index, 12th Edition</ref>

The enzyme [[ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase]] is vital in starch production, but has no connection to lipid synthesis. Removal of this enzyme resulted in the sta6 mutant, which showed increased lipid content. After 18 hours of growth in nitrogen deficient medium the sta6 mutants had on average 17&nbsp;ng triacylglycerides/1000 cells, compared to 10&nbsp;ng/1000 cells in WT cells. This increase in lipid production was attributed to reallocation of intracellular resources, as the algae diverted energy from starch production.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = Z.

===Funding programs===
Numerous Funding programs have been created with aims of promoting the use of Renewable Energy. In Canada, the ecoAgriculture biofuels capital initiative (ecoABC) provides $25 million per project to assist farmers in constructing and expanding a renewable fuel production facility. The program has $186 million set aside for these projects. The sustainable development (SDTC) program has also applied $500 millions over 8 years to assist with the construction of next-generation renewable fuels. In addition, over the last 2 years $10 million has been made available for renewable fuel research and analysis<ref name=""Wood"" />

In Europe, the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) is the main instrument for funding research. Similarly, the NER 300 is an unofficial, independent portal dedicated to renewable energy and grid integration projects. Another program includes the [[Horizon 2020]] program which will start 1 January, and will bring together the framework program and other EC innovation and research funding into a new integrated funding system<ref name=""biofuelstp.eu""/>

The American [[National Biodiesel Board|NBB]]'s [[Biodiesel in the United States#Feedstock development|Feedstock Development program]] is addressing production of algae on the horizon to expand available material for biodiesel in a sustainable manner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biodiesel.org/resources/sustainability/pdfs/Food%20and%20FuelApril162008.pdf|title=404 Error - Biodiesel.org|publisher=}}</ref>

==International policies==

===Canada===
Numerous policies have been put in place since the 1975 oil crisis in order to promote the use of Renewable Fuels in the United States, Canada and Europe. In Canada, these included the implementation of excise taxes exempting propane and natural gas which was extended to ethanol made from biomass and methanol in 1992. The federal government also announced their renewable fuels strategy in 2006 which proposed four components: increasing availability of renewable fuels through regulation, supporting the expansion of Canadian production of renewable fuels, assisting farmers to seize new opportunities in this sector and accelerating the commercialization of new technologies. These mandates were quickly followed by the Canadian provinces:

BC introduced a 5% ethanol and 5% renewable diesel requirement which was effective by January 2010. It also introduced a low carbon fuel requirement for 2012 to 2020.

Alberta introduced a 5% ethanol and 2% renewable diesel requirement implemented April 2011. The province also introduced a minimum 25% GHG emission reduction requirement for qualifying renewable fuels.

Saskatchewan implemented a 2% renewable diesel requirement in 2009.<ref>O'Connor Don, Canadian Energy Legislation. Canadian Biofuel Policies. (S&T) 2 Consultants Inc June, 2011, pp. 1-19.</ref>

Additionally, in 2006, the Canadian Federal Government announced its commitment to using its purchasing power to encourage the biofuel industry. Section three of the 2006 alternative fuels act stated that when it is economically feasible to do so-75% per cent of all federal bodies and crown corporation will be motor vehicles.<ref name=""Wood"">{{Cite journal | last1 = Gao | first1 = Y. | last2 = Gregor | first2 = C. | last3 = Liang | first3 = Y. | last4 = Tang | first4 = D. | last5 = Tweed | first5 = C. | title = Algae biodiesel - a feasibility report | doi = 10.1186/1752-153X-6-S1-S1 | journal = Chemistry Central Journal | volume = 6 | pages = S1 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref>

===United States===
Policies in the United States have included a decrease in the subsidies provided by the federal and state governments to the oil industry which have usually included $2.84 billion. This is more than what is actually set aside for the biofuel industry. The measure was discussed at the G20 in Pittsburgh where leaders agreed that ""inefficient fossil fuel subsidies encourage wasteful consumption, reduce our energy security, impede investment in clean sources and undermine efforts to deal with the threat of climate change"". If this commitment is followed through and subsidies are removed, a fairer market in which algae biofuels can compete will be created. In 2010, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a legislation seeking to give algae-based biofuels parity with cellulose biofuels in federal tax credit programs. The algae-based renewable fuel promotion act (HR 4168) was implemented to give biofuel projects access to a $1.01 per gal production tax credit and 50% bonus depreciation for biofuel plant property. The U.S Government also introduced the domestic Fuel for Enhancing National Security Act implemented in 2011. This policy constitutes an amendment to the Federal property and administrative services act of 1949 and federal defense provisions in order to extend to 15 the number of years that the Department of Defense (DOD) multiyear contract may be entered into the case of the purchase of advanced biofuel. Federal and DOD programs are usually limited to a 5-year period<ref>G20.

With algal biofuel being a relatively new alternative to conventional petroleum products, it leaves numerous opportunities for drastic advances in all aspects of the technology. Producing algae biofuel is not yet a cost-effective replacement for gasoline, but alterations to current methodologies can change this. The two most common targets for advancements are the growth medium (open pond vs. photobioreactor) and methods to remove the intracellular components of the algae. Below are companies that are currently innovating algal biofuel technologies.

Founded in 2006, Algenol Biofuels is a global, industrial biotechnology company that is commercializing its patented algae technology for production of ethanol and other fuels.  Based in Southwest Florida, Algenol's patented technology enables the production of the four most important fuels (ethanol, gasoline, jet, and diesel fuel) using proprietary algae, sunlight, carbon dioxide and saltwater for around $1.27 per gallon and at production levels of 8,000 total gallons of liquid fuel per acre per year. Algenol's technology produces high yields and relies on patented photobioreactors and proprietary downstream techniques for low-cost fuel production using carbon dioxide from industrial sources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://algenol.com/ |title=About Algenol &#124; Algenol Biofuels |publisher=Algenol.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-19}}</ref> The company originally intended on producing commercially by 2014, but was set back when Florida Governor Rick Scott signed a bill in 2013 eliminating the state's mandate of a minimum of 10% ethanol in commercial gasoline.<ref>http://www.nbc-2.com/story/22574373/algenol-governor-rick-scott-algae-ethanol-lee-county#.Ubsmf8u9KSM</ref> This caused Algenol CEO Paul Woods to scrap a plan for a US $500 million plant to produce commercial amounts of algae biofuels and pursue other job sites. Currently, Algenol is a partner of the US Department of Energy's Bioenergy Technologies Office, and in 2015 began smaller-scale commercial sales of E15 and E85 ethanol blends to Protec Fuel, a Florida-based fuel distributor.<ref>http://energy.gov/eere/bioenergy/articles/algenol-announces-commercial-algal-ethanol-fuel-partnership</ref>

===Blue Marble Production===
Blue Marble Production is a Seattle-based company that is dedicated to removing algae from algae-infested water. This in turn cleans up the environment and allows this company to produce biofuel. Rather than just focusing on the mass production of algae, this company focuses on what to do with the byproducts. This company recycles almost 100% of its water via reverse osmosis, saving about 26,000 gallons of water every month. This water is then pumped back into their system. The gas produced as a byproduct of algae will also be recycled by being placed into a photobioreactor system that holds multiple strains of algae. Whatever gas remains is then made into pyrolysis oil by thermochemical processes. Not only does this company seek to produce biofuel, but it also wishes to use algae for a variety of other purposes such as fertilizer, food flavoring, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer drugs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sims|first=B|title=Blue marble, um partner to optimize algal biomass utilization|url=http://www.biorefiningmagazine.com/articles/6004/blue-marble-um-partner-to-optimize-algal-biomass-utilization|accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref>

===Solazyme===
Solazyme is one of a handful of companies which is supported by oil companies such as Chevron. Additionally, this company is also backed by Imperium Renewables, Blue Crest Capital Finance, and The Roda Group. Solazyme has developed a way to use up to 80% percent of dry algae as oil.<ref>{{cite web|author=Nathan |url=http://cleantechnica.com/2013/04/10/breakthrough-in-microalgae-oil-production-accelerated-ability-to-produce-a-variety-of-different-oils/ |title=Breakthrough In Microalgae Oil Production, Accelerated Ability To Produce Variety Of Different Oils |publisher=CleanTechnica |date=2013-04-10 |accessdate=29 November 2013}}</ref> This process requires the algae to grow in a dark fermentation vessel and be fed by carbon substrates within their growth media. The effect is the production of triglycerides that are almost identical to vegetable oil. Solazyme's production method is said to produce more oil than those algae cultivated photosynthetically or made to produce ethanol. Oil refineries can then take this algal oil and turn it into biodiesel, renewable diesel or jet fuels.

Part of Solazyme's testing, in collaboration with Maersk Line and the US Navy, placed 30 tons of Soladiesel(RD) algae fuel into the 98,000-tonne, 300-meter container ship Maersk Kalmar. This fuel was used at blends from 7% to 100% in an auxiliary engine on a month-long trip from Bremerhaven, Germany to Pipavav, India in Dec 2011. In Jul 2012, The US Navy used 700,000 gallons of HRD76 biodiesel in three ships of the USS Nimitz ""Green Strike Group"" during the 2012 RIMPAC exercise in Hawaii. The Nimitz also used 200,000 gallons of HRJ5 jet biofuel. The 50/50 biofuel blends were provided by Solazyme and Dynamic Fuels.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fehrenbacher|first=K|title=15 Algae Startups Bringing Pond Scum to Fuel Tanks|url=http://gigaom.com/cleantech/15-algae-startups-bringing-pond-scum-to-fuel-tanks/|accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Solazyme Integrated Biorefinery: Diesel Fuesl from Heterotrophic algae|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/biomass/pdfs/ibr_arra_solazyme.pdf|accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Solzayme: Meeting the growing need for renewable fuels|url=http://solazyme.com/fuels|accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref>

===Sapphire Energy===
[[Sapphire Energy]] is a leader in the algal biofuel industry backed by the Wellcome Trust, Bill Gates' Cascade Investment, Monsanto, and other large donors.<ref name=""sapphireenergy1"">{{cite web |title=The Sapphire Story| url=http://www.sapphireenergy.com/sapphire-renewable-energy | accessdate=21 April 2014}}</ref> After experimenting with production of various algae fuels beginning in 2007, the company now focuses on producing what it calls ""green crude"" from algae in open raceway ponds. After receiving more than $100 million in federal funds in 2012, Sapphire built the first commercial demonstration algae fuel facility in New Mexico and has continuously produced biofuel since completion of the facility in that year.<ref name=""sapphireenergy1""/> In 2013, Sapphire began commercial sales of algal biofuel to [[Tesoro]], making it one of the first companies, along with Solazyme, to sell algae fuel on the market.<ref name=""Andrew Herndon""/>

===Diversified Technologies Inc.===
Diversified Technologies Inc. has created a patent pending pre-treatment option to reduce costs of oil extraction from algae. This technology, called Pulsed Electric Field (PEF) technology, is a low cost, low energy process that applies high voltage electric pulses to a slurry of algae.<ref>[http://www.divtecs.com Diversified Technology Inc.] (accessed 01/14, 2013).))</ref> The electric pulses enable the algal cell walls to be ruptured easily, increasing the availability of all cell contents (Lipids, proteins and carbohydrates), allowing the separation into specific components downstream. This alternative method to intracellular extraction has shown the capability to be both integrated in-line as well as scalable into high yield assemblies. The Pulse Electric Field subjects the algae to short, intense bursts of electromagnetic radiation in a treatment chamber, electroporating the cell walls. The formation of holes in the cell wall allows the contents within to flow into the surrounding solution for further separation. PEF technology only requires 1-10 microsecond pulses, enabling a high-throughput approach to algal extraction.

Preliminary calculations have shown that utilization of PEF technology would only account for $0.10 per gallon of algae derived biofuel produced. In comparison, conventional drying and solvent-based extractions account for $1.75 per gallon. This inconsistency between costs can be attributed to the fact that algal drying generally accounts for 75% of the extraction process.<ref>Gieskes, Thomas E. Algae Oil Extraction (Powerpoint Presentation), Organic Fuels Holding, Inc., March 2008</ref> Although a relatively new technology, PEF has been successfully used in both food decomtamination processes as well as waste water treatments.<ref>Environmental Protection Agency: [http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncer_abstracts/index.cfm/fuseaction/display.abstractDetail/abstract/5603 Wastewater Treatment by Pulsed Electric Field Processing]. (accessed 01/20, 2013).</ref>

===Origin Oils Inc.===
Origin Oils Inc. has been researching a revolutionary method called the Helix Bioreactor,<ref>deGrasse Tyson, N. PBS Online [http://video.pbs.org/video/1216982026/ Algae Biofuel] (accessed 01/16, 2013).</ref> altering the common closed-loop growth system. This system utilizes low energy lights in a helical pattern, enabling each algal cell to obtain the required amount of light.<ref name=""aquaticbiofuel.com"">Piccolo, T. [http://aquaticbiofuel.com/2008/12/28/originoils-bioreactor-technology-a-breakthrough-in-the-production-of-oil-from-algae/ Origin Oil's Bioreactor: A Breakthrough in the Production of Oil from Algae] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203003555/http://aquaticbiofuel.com/2008/12/28/originoils-bioreactor-technology-a-breakthrough-in-the-production-of-oil-from-algae/ |date=3 December 2013 }}. (accessed 01/16, 2013).))</ref> Sunlight can only penetrate a few inches through algal cells, making light a limiting reagent in open-pond algae farms. Each lighting element in the bioreactor is specially altered to emit specific wavelengths of light, as a full spectrum of light is not beneficial to algae growth. In fact, ultraviolet irradiation is actually detrimental as it inhibits photosynthesis, photoreduction, and the 520&nbsp;nm light-dark absorbance change of algae.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Mantai | first1 = K. E. | last2 = Bishop | first2 = N. I. | doi = 10.1016/0005-2728(67)90148-X | title = Studies on the effects of ultraviolet irradiation on photosynthesis and on the 520 nm light-dark difference spectra in green algae and isolated chloroplasts | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Bioenergetics | volume = 131 | issue = 2 | pages = 350–356 | year = 1967 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref>

This bioreactor also addresses another key issue in algal cell growth; introducing CO<sub>2</sub> and nutrients to the algae without disrupting or over-aerating the algae. Origin Oils Inc. combats this issues through the creation of their Quantum Fracturing technology. This process takes the CO<sub>2</sub> and other nutrients, fractures them at extremely high pressures and then deliver the micron sized bubbles to the algae. This allows the nutrients to be delivered at a much lower pressure, maintaining the integrity of the cells.<ref name=""aquaticbiofuel.com""/>

===Proviron===
Proviron is a Belgian microalgae company that also operates in the United States. The company has been working on a new type of reactor (using flat plates) which reduces the cost of algae cultivation. At [[AlgaePARC]] similar research is being conducted using 4 grow systems (1 open pond system and 3 types of closed systems). According to René Wijffels the current systems do not yet allow algae fuel to be produced competitively. However using new (closed) systems, and by scaling up the production it would be possible to reduce costs by 10X, up to a price of 0,4 € per kg of algae.<ref>EOS magazine, 6, 2012</ref> Currently, Proviron focuses primarily on alternative uses of algae cultures, such as environmentally-conscious plastics, esterification processes, and de-icing processes.<ref>http://www.proviron.be/</ref>

===Genifuels===
Genifuel Corporation has licensed the high temperature/pressure fuel extraction process and has been working with the team at the lab since 2008. The company intends to team with some industrial partners to create a pilot plant using this process to make biofuel in industrial quantities.<ref name=giz1312/> Genifuel process combines hydrothermal liquefaction with catalytic hydrothermal gasification in reactor running at 350 Celsius (662 Fahrenheit) and pressure of 3000 PSI.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pnnl.gov/news/release.aspx?id=1029|title=Algae to crude oil: Million-year natural process takes minutes in the lab|date=17 December 2013|publisher=PNNL|accessdate=16 January 2014}}</ref>

=== Qeshm Microalgae Biorefinery Co. (QMAB) ===
QMAB is an Iran-based biofuels company operating solely on the island of Iranian island of Qeshm in the Strait of Hormuz. QMAB's original pilot plant has been operating since 2009, and has a 25,000 Liter capacity.<ref name=""algaeindustrymagazine.com"">http://www.algaeindustrymagazine.com/qmab-launches-baya-microalgal-biofuel/</ref> In 2014, QMAB released BAYA Biofuel, a biofuel deriving from the algae Nannochloropsis, and has since specified that its unique strain is up to 68% lipids by dry weight volume.<ref name=""algaeindustrymagazine.com""/>
Development of the farm mainly focuses on 2 phases, production of nutraceutical products and green crude oil to produce biofuel. The main product of their microalgae culture is crude oil, which can be fractioned into the same kinds of fuels and chemical compounds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://qmabco.com/|title=Home|website=qmabco.com|access-date=2016-05-08}}</ref>

== History and development ==
In the 20th&nbsp;century, demand for electricity led to the consideration of geothermal power as a generating source. [[Piero Ginori Conti|Prince Piero Ginori Conti]] tested the first geothermal power generator on 4 July 1904 in [[Larderello]], Italy. It successfully lit four light bulbs.<ref>Tiwari, G. N.; Ghosal, M. K. ''Renewable Energy Resources: Basic Principles and Applications.'' Alpha Science Int'l Ltd., 2005 {{ISBN|1-84265-125-0}}</ref> Later, in 1911, the world's first commercial geothermal power station was built there. Experimental generators were built in [[Beppu]], Japan and [[the Geysers]], California, in the 1920s, but Italy was the world's only industrial producer of geothermal electricity until 1958.

In 1958, New Zealand became the second major industrial producer of geothermal electricity when its [[Wairakei Power Station|Wairakei station]] was commissioned. Wairakei was the first station to use flash steam technology.<ref>[http://www.ipenz.org.nz/heritage/itemdetail.cfm?itemid=84 IPENZ Engineering Heritage]. Ipenz.org.nz.

In 2006, a binary cycle station in [[Chena Hot Springs, Alaska]], came on-line, producing electricity from a record low fluid temperature of 57&nbsp;°C (135&nbsp;°F).<ref name=""Chena""/>

Geothermal electric stations have until recently been built exclusively where high temperature geothermal resources are available near the surface.

The [[thermal efficiency]] of geothermal electric stations is low, around 7–10%,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schavemaker|first1=Pieter|last2=van der Sluis|first2=Lou|title=Electrical Power Systems Essentials|date=2008|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd|isbn=978-0470-51027-8}}</ref> because geothermal fluids are at a low temperature compared with steam from boilers. By the laws of [[thermodynamics]] this low temperature limits the efficiency of [[Cycle efficiency|heat engines]] in extracting useful energy during the generation of electricity. Exhaust heat is wasted, unless it can be used directly and locally, for example in greenhouses, timber mills, and district heating. The efficiency of the system does not affect operational costs as it would for a coal or other fossil fuel plant, but it does factor into the viability of the station. In order to produce more energy than the pumps consume, electricity generation requires high temperature geothermal fields and specialized heat cycles.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Because geothermal power does not rely on variable sources of energy, unlike, for example, wind or solar, its [[capacity factor]] can be quite large – up to 96% has been demonstrated.<ref>

The [[Earth's crust]] effectively acts as a thick insulating blanket which must be pierced by fluid conduits (of [[magma]], water or other) to release the heat underneath.

Electricity generation requires high temperature resources that can only come from deep underground. The heat must be carried to the surface by fluid circulation, either through [[magma conduit]]s, [[hot springs]], [[hydrothermal circulation]], [[oil well]]s, drilled water wells, or a combination of these. This circulation sometimes exists naturally where the crust is thin: magma conduits bring heat close to the surface, and hot springs bring the heat to the surface. If no hot spring is available, a well must be drilled into a hot [[aquifer]]. Away from tectonic plate boundaries the [[geothermal gradient]] is 25–30&nbsp;°C per kilometre (km) of depth in most of the world, and wells would have to be several kilometres deep to permit electricity generation.<ref name=""IPCC"" /> The quantity and quality of recoverable resources improves with drilling depth and proximity to tectonic plate boundaries.

In ground that is hot but dry, or where water pressure is inadequate, injected fluid can stimulate production. Developers bore two holes into a candidate site, and fracture the rock between them with explosives or high pressure water. Then they pump water or liquefied carbon dioxide down one borehole, and it comes up the other borehole as a gas.<ref name=""INEL"" /> This approach is called [[hot dry rock geothermal energy]] in Europe, or [[enhanced geothermal systems]] in North America. Much greater potential may be available from this approach than from conventional tapping of natural aquifers.<ref name=""INEL"" />

Estimates of the electricity generating potential of geothermal energy vary from 35 to 2000&nbsp;GW depending on the scale of investments.<ref name=""IPCC""/> This does not include non-electric heat recovered by co-generation, geothermal heat pumps and other direct use. A 2006 report by [[MIT|the Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), that included the potential of enhanced geothermal systems, estimated that investing 1&nbsp;billion US&nbsp;dollars in research and development over 15&nbsp;years would allow the creation of 100&nbsp;GW of electrical generating capacity by 2050 in the United States alone.<ref name=""INEL""/> The MIT report estimated that over 200&nbsp;[[zettajoule]]s&nbsp;(ZJ) would be extractable, with the potential to increase this to over 2,000&nbsp;ZJ with technology improvements – sufficient to provide all the world's present energy needs for several [[Millennium|millennia]].<ref name=""INEL"" />

At present, geothermal wells are rarely more than {{convert|3|km|mi|1}} deep.<ref name=""IPCC"" /> Upper estimates of geothermal resources assume wells as deep as {{convert|10|km|mi|1}}. Drilling near this depth is now possible in the petroleum industry, although it is an expensive process.

Geothermal power is considered to be sustainable because the heat extraction is small compared to the Earth's heat content, but extraction must still be monitored to avoid local depletion.<ref name=""sustainability"" /> Although geothermal sites are capable of providing heat for many decades, individual wells may cool down or run out of water. The three oldest sites, at Larderello, [[Wairakei#Geothermal field|Wairakei]], and the Geysers have all reduced production from their peaks. It is not clear whether these stations extracted energy faster than it was replenished from greater depths, or whether the aquifers supplying them are being depleted. If production is reduced, and water is reinjected, these wells could theoretically recover their full potential. Such mitigation strategies have already been implemented at some sites. The long-term sustainability of geothermal energy has been demonstrated at the Lardarello field in Italy since 1913, at the Wairakei field in New Zealand since 1958,<ref name=""Wairakei"">

Geothermal power stations are similar to other steam turbine [[thermal power station]]s – heat from a fuel source (in geothermal's case, the earth's core) is used to heat water or another working fluid. The working fluid is then used to turn a turbine of a generator, thereby producing electricity. The fluid is then cooled and returned to the heat source.

=== Dry steam power stations ===
Dry steam stations are the simplest and oldest design. They directly use geothermal steam of 150&nbsp;°C or greater to turn turbines.<ref name=""IPCC"">{{Citation|first1=Ingvar B. |last1=Fridleifsson, |first2=Ruggero |last2=Bertani |first3=Ernst |last3=Huenges |first4=John W. |last4=Lund |first5=Arni |last5=Ragnarsson |first6=Ladislaus |last6=Rybach |date=11 February 2008 |title=The possible role and contribution of geothermal energy to the mitigation of climate change |conference=IPCC Scoping Meeting on Renewable Energy Sources |editor=O.

=== Flash steam power stations ===
Flash steam stations pull deep, high-pressure hot water into lower-pressure tanks and use the resulting flashed steam to drive turbines. They require fluid temperatures of at least 180&nbsp;°C, usually more. This is the most common type of station in operation today. Flash Steam plants use geothermal reservoirs of water with temperatures greater than 360&nbsp;°F (182&nbsp;°C). The hot water flows up through wells in the ground under its own pressure. As it flows upward, the pressure decreases and some of the hot water boils into steam. The steam is then separated from the water and used to power a turbine/generator. Any leftover water and condensed steam may be injected back into the reservoir, making this a potentially sustainable resource.<ref>[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/powerplants.html US DOE EERE Hydrothermal Power Systems]. eere.energy.gov (22 February 2012).

Fluids drawn from the deep earth carry a mixture of gases, notably [[carbon dioxide]] ({{chem|CO|2|}}), [[hydrogen sulfide]] ({{chem|H|2|S|}}), [[methane]] ({{chem|CH|4|}}), [[ammonia]] ({{chem|NH|3|}}) and [[radon]] ({{chem|Rn|}}). These pollutants contribute to [[global warming]], [[acid rain]], radiation and noxious smells if released.

Existing geothermal electric stations, that fall within the [[Percentile|50th percentile]] of all total life cycle emissions studies reviewed by the [[IPCC]], produce on average 45&nbsp;kg of {{chem|CO|2|}} equivalent emissions per megawatt-hour of generated electricity (kg {{chem|CO|2|}}eq/[[megawatt-hour|MW·h]]). For comparison, a coal-fired power plant emits 1,001&nbsp;kg of {{chem|CO|2|}} per megawatt-hour when not coupled with [[carbon capture and storage]] (CCS).<ref name=""IPCC Annex II"" />

Stations that experience high levels of acids and volatile chemicals are usually equipped with emission-control systems to reduce the exhaust. Geothermal stations could theoretically inject these gases back into the earth, as a form of carbon capture and storage.

In addition to dissolved gases, hot water from geothermal sources may hold in solution trace amounts of toxic chemicals, such as [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[arsenic]], [[boron]], [[antimony]], and salt.<ref name=""toxic"">

Geothermal power stations can also disrupt the natural cycles of geysers. For example, the [[Beowawe, Nevada]] geysers, which were uncapped geothermal wells, stopped erupting due to the development of the dual-flash station.

== Economics ==
Geothermal power requires no fuel; it is therefore immune to fuel cost fluctuations. However, [[capital costs]] tend to be high. Drilling accounts for over half the costs, and exploration of deep resources entails significant risks. A typical well doublet in Nevada can support 4.5 [[megawatts]] (MW) of electricity generation and costs about $10 million to drill, with a 20% failure rate.<ref name=""econ101"">

==Chemistry==
[[File:Ethanol-3d-stick-structure.svg|thumb|Structure of ethanol molecule. All bonds are [[single bond]]s]]

During [[ethanol fermentation]], [[glucose]] and other sugars in the corn  (or sugarcane or other crops) are converted into ethanol and [[carbon dioxide]].
:C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> → 2 C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH+ 2 CO<sub>2</sub> + heat

Ethanol fermentation is not 100% selective with other side products such as acetic acid, glycols and many other products produced.  They are mostly removed during ethanol purification. Fermentation takes place in an aqueous solution. The resulting solution has an ethanol content of around 15%. Ethanol is subsequently isolated and purified by a combination of adsorption and distillation.

During combustion, ethanol reacts with [[oxygen]] to produce carbon dioxide, water, and heat:
:C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH + 3 O<sub>2</sub> → 2 CO<sub>2</sub> + 3 H<sub>2</sub>O + heat

[[Starch]] and [[cellulose]] molecules are strings of glucose molecules. It is also possible to generate ethanol out of cellulosic materials. That, however, requires a pretreatment that splits the cellulose into glycose molecules and other sugars that subsequently can be fermented. The resulting product is called [[cellulosic ethanol]], indicating its source.

Ethanol may also be produced industrially from [[ethylene]] by [[hydration reaction|hydration]] of the [[double bond]] in the presence of catalysts and high temperature.
:C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O → C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH

By far the largest fraction of the global ethanol production, however, is produced by fermentation.

[[Bio-ethanol]] is usually obtained from the conversion of carbon-based [[feedstock]]. Agricultural feedstocks are considered renewable because they get energy from the sun using photosynthesis, provided that all minerals required for growth (such as nitrogen and phosphorus) are returned to the land. Ethanol can be produced from a variety of feedstocks such as [[sugar cane]], [[bagasse]], [[miscanthus]], [[sugar beet]], [[sorghum]], grain, [[switchgrass]], [[barley]], [[hemp]], [[kenaf]], [[potato]]es, [[sweet potato]]es, [[cassava]], [[sunflower]], [[fruit]], [[molasses]], [[maize|corn]], [[stover]], [[grain]], [[wheat]], [[straw]], [[cotton]], other [[biomass]], as well as many types of cellulose waste and harvesting, whichever has the best [[well-to-wheel]] assessment.

An alternative process to produce bio-ethanol from algae is being developed by the company [[Algenol]]. Rather than grow [[algae]] and then harvest and ferment it, the algae grow in sunlight and produce ethanol directly, which is removed without killing the algae. It is claimed the process can produce  {{convert|6000|usgal/acre|impgal/acre L/ha|abbr=none|sp=us}} per year compared with {{convert|400|usgal/acre|impgal/acre L/ha}} for corn production.<ref>{{cite web|author=Martin LaMonica |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-9966867-54.html |title=Algae farm in Mexico to produce ethanol in '09 |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=12 June 2008 |accessdate=27 August 2011}}</ref>

Currently, the first generation processes for the production of ethanol from corn use only a small part of the corn plant: the corn kernels are taken from the corn plant and only the starch, which represents about 50% of the dry kernel mass, is transformed into ethanol. Two types of second generation processes are under development. The first type uses [[enzyme]]s and [[yeast]] [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] to convert the plant cellulose into ethanol while the second type uses [[pyrolysis]] to convert the whole plant to either a liquid [[bio-oil]] or a [[syngas]]. Second generation processes can also be used with plants such as grasses, wood or agricultural waste material such as straw.

==Production==
Although there are [[Ethanol#Production|various ways on how ethanol fuel can be produced]], we hereby describe the most common way of producing ethanol: via fermentation.

The basic steps for large-scale production of ethanol are: microbial ([[yeast]]) [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] of sugars, [[distillation]], [[dehydration]] (requirements vary, see Ethanol fuel mixtures, below), and [[denatured alcohol|denaturing]] (optional). Prior to fermentation, some crops require [[saccharification]] or [[hydrolysis]] of carbohydrates such as cellulose and starch into sugars. Saccharification of cellulose is called [[cellulolysis]] (see [[cellulosic ethanol]]). Enzymes are used to convert starch into sugar.<ref>{{cite web

===Fermentation===
{{Main article|Ethanol fermentation}}
Ethanol is produced by [[microbial fermentation]] of the sugar. Microbial fermentation currently only works directly with [[sugar]]s. Two major components of plants, [[starch]] and cellulose, are both made of sugars—and can, in principle, be converted to sugars for fermentation. Currently, only the sugar (e.g., sugar cane) and starch (e.g., corn) portions can be economically converted. There is much activity in the area of cellulosic ethanol, where the cellulose part of a plant is broken down to sugars and subsequently converted to ethanol.

===Distillation===
[[File:Ethanol plant.jpg|thumb|right|Ethanol plant in West [[Burlington, Iowa]] ]]
[[File:UsinaSantaElisa.jpg|thumb|right|Ethanol plant in Sertãozinho, Brazil.]]
For the ethanol to be usable as a fuel, the yeast solids and the majority of the water must be removed.  After fermentation, the [[Mashing|mash]] is heated so that the ethanol evaporates.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ethanol|url=https://web.extension.illinois.edu/ethanol/|website=University of Illinois Extention|accessdate=10 July 2017}}</ref>  This process, known as [[distillation]], separates the ethanol, but its purity is limited to 95–96% due to the formation of a low-boiling water-ethanol [[azeotrope]] with maximum (95.6% m/m (96.5% v/v) ethanol and 4.4% m/m (3.5% v/v) water).  This mixture is called hydrous ethanol and can be used as a fuel alone, but unlike [[anhydrous]] ethanol, hydrous ethanol is not miscible in all ratios with gasoline, so the water fraction is typically removed in further treatment to burn in combination with gasoline in gasoline engines.<ref name=DSATC>{{cite conference |first=Orlando |last=Volpato Filho |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309564235_GASOLINE_C_MADE_WITH_HYDROUS_ETHANOL |title=Gasoline C made with Hydrous Ethanol |date=September 2008 |conference=XVI SIMEA 2008 - Simpósio Internacional de Engenharia Automotiva |location=Sao Paolo |accessdate=10 July 2017}}</ref>

===Dehydration===
There are basically three dehydration processes to remove the water from an [[azeotropic]] ethanol/water mixture. The first process, used in many early fuel ethanol plants, is called [[azeotropic distillation]] and consists of adding [[benzene]] or [[cyclohexane]] to the mixture. When these components are added to the mixture, it forms a heterogeneous azeotropic mixture in [[Vapor–liquid equilibrium|vapor–liquid-liquid equilibrium]], which when distilled produces anhydrous ethanol in the column bottom, and a vapor mixture of water, ethanol, and cyclohexane/benzene.

When condensed, this becomes a two-phase liquid mixture. The heavier phase, poor in the entrainer (benzene or cyclohexane), is stripped of the entrainer and recycled to the feed—while the lighter phase, with condensate from the stripping, is recycled to the second column. Another early method, called [[extractive distillation]], consists of adding a ternary component that increases ethanol's relative volatility. When the ternary mixture is distilled, it produces anhydrous ethanol on the top stream of the column.

With increasing attention being paid to saving energy, many methods have been proposed that avoid distillation altogether for dehydration. Of these methods, a third method has emerged and has been adopted by the majority of modern ethanol plants. This new process uses [[molecular sieves]] to remove water from fuel ethanol. In this process, ethanol vapor under pressure passes through a bed of molecular sieve beads. The bead's pores are sized to allow [[adsorption]] of water while excluding ethanol. After a period of time, the bed is regenerated under vacuum or in the flow of inert atmosphere (e.g. N<sub>2</sub>) to remove the adsorbed water. Two beds are often used so that one is available to adsorb water while the other is being regenerated. This dehydration technology can account for energy saving of 3,000 btus/gallon (840 k[[joule|J]]/L) compared to earlier azeotropic distillation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bioethanol.ru/images/bioethanol/Fuel%20ethanol%20production%20-%20Katzen.pdf|format=PDF|title=Modern Corn Ethanol plant description}}</ref>

===Post-production water issues===
Ethanol is [[hygroscopic]], meaning it absorbs water vapor directly from the atmosphere. Because absorbed water dilutes the fuel value of the ethanol and may cause phase separation of ethanol-gasoline blends (which causes engine stall), containers of ethanol fuels must be kept tightly sealed. This high [[miscibility]] with water means that ethanol cannot be efficiently shipped through modern [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]], like liquid hydrocarbons, over long distances.<ref>W. Horn and F. Krupp. Earth: The Sequel: The Race to Reinvent Energy and Stop Global Warming. 2006, 85</ref>

The fraction of water that an ethanol-gasoline fuel can contain without phase separation increases with the percentage of ethanol.<ref>This is shown for 25&nbsp;°C (77&nbsp;°F) in a gasoline-ethanol-water phase diagram, Fig 13 of {{cite web|url=http://www.vtt.fi/inf/julkaisut/muut/2004/EtOH_VTT5100_03.pdf|title=Technical View on Biofuels for Transportation – Focus on Ethanol End-Use Aspects|author= Päivi Aakko|author2=Nils-Olof Nylund|format=PDF|accessdate=14 January 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203173845/http://www.vtt.fi/inf/julkaisut/muut/2004/EtOH_VTT5100_03.pdf |archivedate=3 December 2007}}</ref> For example, E30 can have up to about 2% water. If there is more than about 71% ethanol, the remainder can be any proportion of water or gasoline and phase separation does not occur. The fuel mileage declines with increased water content. The increased solubility of water with higher ethanol content permits E30 and hydrated ethanol to be put in the same tank since any combination of them always results in a single phase. Somewhat less water is tolerated at lower temperatures. For E10 it is about 0.5% v/v at 70 F and decreases to about 0.23% v/v at −30 F.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/OMS/regs/fuels/rfg/waterphs.pdf|format=PDF|title=Water Phase Separation in Oxygenated Gasoline|publisher=Epa.gov|accessdate=20 January 2015}} {{Dead link|date=July 2017}}</ref>

===Consumer production systems===
While [[biodiesel]] production systems have been marketed to home and business users for many years, commercialized ethanol production systems designed for end-consumer use have lagged in the marketplace. In 2008, two different companies announced home-scale ethanol production systems. The AFS125 Advanced Fuel System<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gas2.org/2008/11/04/home-mini-refinery-makes-ethanol-biodiesel-simultaneously/#more-1219|title=Home Mini-Refinery Makes Ethanol & Biodiesel Simultaneously|date=4 November 2008|publisher=Gas2.0|accessdate=4 November 2008}}</ref> from Allard Research and Development is capable of producing both ethanol and biodiesel in one machine, while the E-100 MicroFueler<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/blogs/science_news/4262690.html|title=Micro Fueler Is First Ethanol Kit for Brewing Backyard Biofuels on the Cheap|date=8 May 2008|publisher=PopularMechanics|accessdate=8 May 2008}}</ref> from E-Fuel Corporation is dedicated to ethanol only.

==Engines==

===Fuel economy===
Ethanol contains approx. 34% less energy per unit volume than gasoline, and therefore in theory, burning pure ethanol in a vehicle reduces miles  per US gallon 34%, given the same [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]], compared to burning pure gasoline. However, since ethanol has a higher octane rating, the engine can be made more efficient by raising its compression ratio. Using a variable geometry or twin scroll [[turbocharger]], the compression ratio can be optimized for the fuel, making fuel economy almost constant for any blend.<ref name=EEREFAQ>{{cite web|url=http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/ethanol/|title=Alternative Fuels Data Center: Ethanol|publisher=Afdc.energy.gov|accessdate=20 January 2015}}</ref><ref name=EIAATTF>{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/solar.renewables/alt_trans_fuel/attf.pdf#page=39 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821085349/http://www.eia.doe.gov |archivedate=21 August 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref>

Brazilian flex fuel vehicles can operate with ethanol mixtures up to [[Neat alcohol fuel|E100]], which is [[hydrous]] ethanol (with up to 4% water), which causes vapor pressure to drop faster as compared to E85 vehicles. As a result, Brazilian flex vehicles are built with a small secondary gasoline reservoir located near the engine. During a cold start pure gasoline is injected to avoid starting problems at low temperatures. This provision is particularly necessary for users of Brazil's southern and central regions, where temperatures normally drop below {{convert|15|C|F|lk=on}} during the winter. An improved flex engine generation was launched in 2009 that eliminates the need for the secondary gas storage tank.<ref name=""BioEnergia"">{{cite journal|url=http://cenbio.iee.usp.br/download/revista/RBB3.pdf |format=PDF |title=Here comes the 'Flex' vehicles third generation |journal=Revista Brasileira de BioEnergia |publisher=Centro Nacional de Referência em Biomassa (Cenbio) |date=August 2008 |accessdate=23 September 2008 |language=Portuguese, English |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003062358/http://cenbio.iee.usp.br/download/revista/RBB3.pdf |archivedate=3 October 2008 |df=dmy }} Ano 2, No. 3 (every article is presented in both English and Portuguese)</ref><ref name=""Gazeta"">{{cite news|url=http://portal.rpc.com.br/gazetadopovo/economia/conteudo.phtml?tl=1&id=774927&tit= |title=Bosch investe na segunda geração do motor flex |publisher=Gazeta do Povo |author=Agência Estado |date=10 June 2008 |accessdate=23 September 2008 |language=Portuguese, English |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110180712/http://portal.rpc.com.br:80/gazetadopovo/economia/conteudo.phtml?tl=1&id=774927&tit= |archivedate=10 January 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref> In March 2009 [[Volkswagen do Brasil]] launched the [[Volkswagen Polo|Polo E-Flex]], the first Brazilian flex fuel model without an auxiliary tank for cold start.<ref name=""FlexStart1"">{{cite news|url=http://quatrorodas.abril.com.br/carros/lancamentos/volkswagen-polo-e-flex-425390.shtml |author=Q.

In many countries cars are mandated to run on mixtures of ethanol. All Brazilian light-duty vehicles are built to operate for an ethanol blend of up to 25% ([[E20 fuel|E25]]), and since 1993 a federal law requires mixtures between 22% and 25% ethanol, with 25% required as of mid July 2011.<ref name=USP>{{cite web|url=http://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/86/86131/tde-07052008-115336/|author=Julieta Andrea Puerto Rico|title=Programa de Biocombustíveis no Brasil e na Colômbia: uma análise da implantação, resultados e perspectivas|publisher=[[Universidade de São Paulo]]|date=8 May 2008|language=Portuguese|accessdate=5 October 2008}} PhD Dissertation Thesis, pp. 81–82</ref> In the United States all light-duty vehicles are built to operate normally with an ethanol blend of 10% ([[E10 fuel|E10]]).

Beginning with the model year 1999, an increasing number of vehicles in the world are manufactured with engines that can run on any fuel from 0% ethanol up to 100% ethanol without modification. Many cars and [[light truck]]s (a class containing [[minivan]]s, [[sport utility vehicle|SUV]]s and [[pickup truck]]s) are designed to be flexible-fuel vehicles using ethanol blends up to 85% ([[E85]]) in North America and Europe, and up to 100% (E100) in Brazil. In older model years, their engine systems contained alcohol sensors in the fuel and/or oxygen sensors in the exhaust that provide input to the engine control computer to adjust the fuel injection to achieve [[stochiometric]] (no residual fuel or free oxygen in the exhaust) air-to-fuel ratio for any fuel mix. In newer models, the alcohol sensors have been removed, with the computer using only oxygen and airflow sensor feedback to estimate alcohol content. The engine control computer can also adjust (advance) the ignition timing to achieve a higher output without pre-ignition when it predicts that higher alcohol percentages are present in the fuel being burned. This method is backed up by advanced knock sensors – used in most high performance gasoline engines regardless of whether they are designed to use ethanol or not – that detect pre-ignition and detonation.

===Other engine configurations===

;ED95 engines

Since 1989 there have also been ethanol engines based on the diesel principle operating in Sweden.<ref name=Scania1>[http://www.scania.com/Images/P07503EN%20New%20ethanol%20engine_tcm10-163550.pdf]  Scania PRESSInfo, 21 May 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320033944/http://www.scania.com/Images/P07503EN%20New%20ethanol%20engine_tcm10-163550.pdf |date=20 March 2009 }}</ref> They are used primarily in city buses, but also in distribution trucks and waste collectors. The engines, made by [[Scania AB|Scania]], have a modified compression ratio, and the fuel (known as ED95) used is a mix of 93.6% ethanol and 3.6% ignition improver, and 2.8% [[Denaturation (food)|denaturant]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ethanolproducer.com/article.jsp?article_id=3888|title=Ethanol Producer Magazine – The Latest News and Data About Ethanol Production|publisher=Ethanolproducer.com|accessdate=20 January 2015}}</ref> The ignition improver makes it possible for the fuel to ignite in the diesel combustion cycle. It is then also possible to use the energy efficiency of the diesel principle with ethanol. These engines have been used in the United Kingdom by [[Reading Buses#Biofuel usage|Reading Buses]] but the use of bioethanol fuel is now being phased out.

;Dual-fuel direct-injection

A 2004 [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] study and an earlier paper published by the Society of Automotive Engineers identified a method to exploit the characteristics of fuel ethanol substantially more efficiently than mixing it with gasoline. The method presents the possibility of leveraging the use of alcohol to achieve definite improvement over the cost-effectiveness of hybrid electric. The improvement consists of using dual-fuel direct-injection of pure alcohol (or the azeotrope or E85) and gasoline, in any ratio up to 100% of either, in a turbocharged, high compression-ratio, small-displacement engine having performance similar to an engine having twice the displacement. Each fuel is carried separately, with a much smaller tank for alcohol. The high-compression (for higher efficiency) engine runs on ordinary gasoline under low-power cruise conditions. Alcohol is directly injected into the cylinders (and the gasoline injection simultaneously reduced) only when necessary to suppress ‘knock’ such as when significantly accelerating. Direct cylinder injection raises the already high octane rating of ethanol up to an effective 130. The calculated over-all reduction of gasoline use and CO<sub>2</sub> emission is 30%. The consumer cost payback time shows a 4:1 improvement over turbo-diesel and a 5:1 improvement over hybrid. The problems of water absorption into pre-mixed gasoline (causing phase separation), supply issues of multiple mix ratios and cold-weather starting are also avoided.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.psfc.mit.edu/library1/catalog/reports/2000/06ja/06ja016/06ja016_full.pdf |title=Direct Injection Ethanol Boosted Gasoline Engines: Biofuel Leveraging for Cost Effective Reduction of Oil Dependence and CO2 Emissions.

;Increased thermal efficiency

In a 2008 study, complex engine controls and increased exhaust gas recirculation allowed a compression ratio of 19.5 with fuels ranging from neat ethanol to E50. Thermal efficiency up to approximately that for a diesel was achieved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/otaq/presentations/epa-fev-isaf-no55.pdf|title=Economical, High-Efficiency Engine Technologies for Alcohol Fuels|author1=M.

Bakenhus | format=PDF| publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=14 January 2008}}</ref> This would result in the [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] of a neat ethanol vehicle to be about the same as one burning gasoline.

;Fuel cells powered by an ethanol reformer
In June 2016, [[Nissan]] announced plans to develop [[fuel cell vehicle]]s powered by ethanol rather than [[hydrogen]], the fuel of choice by the other car manufacturers that have developed and commercialized fuel cell vehicles, such as the [[Hyundai Tucson FCEV]], [[Toyota Mirai]], and [[Honda FCX Clarity]]. The main advantage of this technical approach is that it would be cheaper and easier to deploy the fueling infrastructure than setting up the one required to deliver hydrogen at high pressures, as each hydrogen fueling station cost {{USD|1 million}} to {{USD|2 million}} to build.<ref name=NissanEthanol/>

Nissan plans to create a technology that uses liquid ethanol fuel as a source to generate hydrogen within the vehicle itself. The technology uses heat to reform ethanol into hydrogen to feed what is known as a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). The fuel cell generates electricity to supply power to the electric motor driving the wheels, through a battery that handles peak power demands and stores regenerated energy. The vehicle would include a tank for a blend of water and ethanol, which is fed into an onboard reformer that splits it into pure hydrogen and carbon dioxide. According to Nissan, the liquid fuel could be an ethanol-water blend at a 55:45 ratio. Nissan expects to  commercialize its technology by 2020.<ref name=NissanEthanol>{{cite news| url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1104467_nissan-takes-a-different-approach-to-fuel-cells-ethanol | title=Nissan takes a different approach to fuel cells: ethanol | first=John | last=Voelcker | work=Green Car Reports| date=2016-06-14| accessdate=2016-06-16}}</ref>

{{Main article|Ethanol fuel energy balance}}
All biomass goes through at least some of these steps: it needs to be grown, collected, dried, fermented, distilled, and burned. All of these steps require resources and an infrastructure. The total amount of energy input into the process compared to the energy released by burning the resulting ethanol fuel is known as the '''energy balance''' (or ""[[energy returned on energy invested]]""). Figures compiled in a 2007 by ''[[National Geographic Magazine]]''<ref name=bourne/> point to modest results for corn ethanol produced in the US: one unit of fossil-fuel energy is required to create 1.3 energy units from the resulting ethanol. The energy balance for sugarcane ethanol produced in Brazil is more favorable, with one unit of fossil-fuel energy required to create 8 from the ethanol. Energy balance estimates are not easily produced, thus numerous such reports have been generated that are contradictory. For instance, a separate survey reports that production of ethanol from sugarcane, which requires a tropical climate to grow productively, returns from 8 to 9 units of energy for each unit expended, as compared to corn, which only returns about 1.34 units of fuel energy for each unit of energy expended.<ref name=""BIOFUELS"">[http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2004/biofuels2004.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908130551/http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2004/biofuels2004.pdf |date=8 September 2015 }}</ref> A 2006 University of California Berkeley study, after analyzing six separate studies, concluded that producing ethanol from corn uses much less petroleum than producing gasoline.<ref name=""UCB"">{{cite web|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2006/01/26_ethanol.shtml|title=01.26.2006 - Ethanol can replace gasoline with significant energy savings, comparable impact on greenhouse gases|publisher=Berkeley.edu|accessdate=20 January 2015}}</ref>

===Air pollution===
Compared with conventional [[unleaded gasoline]], ethanol is a particulate-free burning fuel source that combusts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water and [[aldehydes]]. The [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] requires the addition of [[oxygenate]]s to reduce carbon monoxide emissions in the United States. The additive [[MTBE]] is currently being phased out due to ground water contamination, hence ethanol becomes an attractive alternative additive. Current production methods include air pollution from the manufacturer of macronutrient [[fertilizer]]s such as ammonia.

A study by atmospheric scientists at Stanford University found that E85 fuel would increase the risk of air pollution deaths relative to gasoline by 9% in Los Angeles, US: a very large, urban, car-based metropolis that is a worst-case scenario.<ref name=""stanfordpollutionstudy"">{{cite news|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=18 April 2007|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/04/18/MNG7EPAN601.DTL|title=Study warns of health risk from ethanol|accessdate=7 July 2009 | first=Keay | last=Davidson}}</ref> [[Ozone]] levels are significantly increased, thereby increasing photochemical smog and aggravating medical problems such as asthma.<ref>{{cite web

{{nowrap|The calculation}} of exactly how much carbon dioxide is produced in the manufacture of bioethanol is a complex and inexact process, and is highly dependent on the method by which the ethanol is produced and the assumptions made in the calculation. A calculation should include:
*The cost of growing the feedstock
*The cost of transporting the feedstock to the factory
*The cost of processing the feedstock into bioethanol
Such a calculation may or may not consider the following effects:
*The cost of the change in land use of the area where the fuel feedstock is grown.
*The cost of transportation of the bioethanol from the factory to its point of use
*The efficiency of the bioethanol compared with standard gasoline
*The amount of carbon dioxide produced at the tail pipe.
*The benefits due to the production of useful bi-products, such as [[cattle feed]] or electricity.

The January 2006 Science article from UC Berkeley's ERG, estimated reduction from corn ethanol in GHG to be 13% after reviewing a large number of studies. In a correction to that article released shortly after publication, they reduce the estimated value to 7.4%. A [[National Geographic Magazine]] overview article (2007)<ref name=bourne/> puts the figures at 22% less CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in production and use for corn ethanol compared to gasoline and a 56% reduction for cane ethanol. Carmaker Ford reports a 70% reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions with bioethanol compared to petrol for one of their flexible-fuel vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eubia.org/fileadmin/template/main/res/pics/projects/RESTMAC_-_Bioethanol_Production___Use.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128055459/http://www.eubia.org/fileadmin/template/main/res/pics/projects/RESTMAC_-_Bioethanol_Production___Use.pdf|archivedate=28 November 2007|title=Bioethanol Production and Use Creating Markets for Renewable Energy Technologies|work=eubia.org|format=PDF|publisher= EU, RES Technology Marketing Campaign, European Biomass Industry Association EUBIA|year= 2007}}</ref>

===Change in land use===
{{See also|Indirect land use change impacts of biofuels|Fuel vs. food}}
Large-scale farming is necessary to produce agricultural alcohol and this requires substantial amounts of cultivated land. University of Minnesota researchers report that if all corn grown in the U.S. were used to make ethanol it would displace 12% of current U.S. gasoline consumption.<ref name=""cornundrum"">{{cite web|url=http://www1.umn.edu/umnnews/Feature_Stories/Ethanol_fuel_presents_a_cornundrum.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922221657/http://www1.umn.edu/umnnews/Feature_Stories/Ethanol_fuel_presents_a_cornundrum.html|archivedate=2007-09-22|title=Ethanol fuel presents a corn-undrum|author=D.

Cellulosic ethanol production is a new approach that may alleviate land use and related concerns. Cellulosic ethanol can be produced from any plant material, potentially doubling yields, in an effort to minimize conflict between food needs vs. fuel needs. Instead of utilizing only the starch by-products from grinding wheat and other crops, cellulosic ethanol production maximizes the use of all plant materials, including gluten. This approach would have a smaller [[carbon footprint]] because the amount of energy-intensive fertilisers and fungicides remain the same for higher output of usable material. The technology for producing cellulosic ethanol is currently in the [[Cellulosic ethanol commercialization|commercialization stage]].<ref name=autogenerated5 /><ref name=autogenerated1 />

====Using biomass for electricity instead of ethanol====
Converting biomass to electricity for charging electric vehicles may be a more ""climate-friendly"" transportation option than using biomass to produce ethanol fuel, according to an analysis published in Science in May 2009<ref>Greater Transportation Energy and GHG Offsets from Bioelectricity Than Ethanol
Campbell, et al.
Science 22 May 2009: 1055–1057.
DOI:10.1126/science.1168885</ref> Researchers continue to search for more cost-effective developments in both cellulosic ethanol and advanced vehicle batteries.<ref>Block, Ben, ""Study: biofuels more efficient as electricity source. (EYE ON EARTH)(Brief article)"" World Watch 22.</ref>

====Health costs of ethanol emissions====
For each billion ethanol-equivalent gallons of fuel produced and combusted in the US, the combined climate-change and health costs are $469 million for gasoline, $472–952 million for corn ethanol depending on biorefinery heat source (natural gas, corn stover, or coal) and technology, but only $123–208 million for cellulosic ethanol depending on feedstock (prairie biomass, Miscanthus, corn stover, or switchgrass).<ref>Hill, Jason, Stephen Polasky, Erik Nelson, David Tilman, Hong Huo, Lindsay Ludwig, James Neumann, Haochi Zheng, and Diego Bonta. ""Climate change and health costs of air emissions from biofuels and gasoline. (SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE)(Author abstract)."" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States 106.6 (10 February 2009): 2077(6). Expanded Academic ASAP. Gale. BENTLEY UPPER SCHOOL LIBRARY (BAISL). 6 October 2009</ref>

==Efficiency of common crops==
As ethanol yields improve or different feedstocks are introduced, ethanol production may become more economically feasible in the US. Currently, research on improving ethanol yields from each unit of corn is underway using biotechnology. Also, as long as oil prices remain high, the economical use of other feedstocks, such as [[cellulose]], become viable. By-products such as straw or wood chips can be converted to ethanol. Fast growing species like [[switchgrass]] can be grown on land not suitable for other cash crops and yield high levels of ethanol per unit area.<ref name=bourne />

==Reduced petroleum imports and costs==
One rationale given for extensive ethanol production in the U.S. is its benefit to [[energy security]], by shifting the need for some foreign-produced oil to domestically produced energy sources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ethanol.org/pdf/contentmgmt/Energy_Security_Issue_Brief.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/678jvRqVo?url=http%3A%2F%2Fethanol.org%2Fpdf%2Fcontentmgmt%2FEnergy_Security_Issue_Brief.pdf |archivedate=23 April 2012 |title=Energy Security |publisher=Ethanol.org |accessdate=27 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref><ref name=""Turon1998"">{{Cite book|author=M.

According to a 2008 analysis by Iowa State University, the growth in US ethanol production has caused retail gasoline prices to be US $0.29 to US $0.40 per gallon lower than would otherwise have been the case.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/infocus/story?id=52564 |title=Ethanol Lowers Gas Prices 29–40 Cents Per Gallon |publisher=Renewableenergyworld.com |accessdate=27 August 2011}}</ref>

==Motorsport==
[[Leon Duray]] qualified third for the [[1927 Indianapolis 500]] auto race with an ethanol-fueled car.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motor.com/article.asp?article_ID=1064|title=Texas Students Win National Auto Repair Crown|publisher=Motor.com|accessdate=20 January 2015}}</ref> The [[IndyCar Series]] adopted a 10% ethanol blend for the 2006 season, and a 98% blend in 2007.

In drag racing, there are [[Top Alcohol]] classes for [[dragster (car)|dragster]]s and [[funny car]]s since the 1970s.

The [[American Le Mans Series]] sports car championship introduced E10 in the 2007 season to replace pure gasoline. In the 2008 season, E85 was allowed in the GT class and teams began switching to it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/motor/2008-01-15-corvette-e85_N.htm|title=ALMS Corvettes going green with E85 fuel in 2008 - USATODAY.com|publisher=Usatoday30.usatoday.com|accessdate=20 January 2015}}</ref>

In 2011, the three national [[NASCAR]] stock car series mandated a switch from gasoline to E15, a blend of Sunoco GTX unleaded racing fuel and 15% ethanol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nascar/story/NASCAR-expected-to-make-move-to-E15-fuel-blend-for-2011-10150|title=NASCAR|author=Fox Sports|work=FOX Sports|accessdate=20 January 2015}}</ref>

Australia's [[V8 Supercar]] championship uses United E85 for its racing fuel.

[[Stock Car Brasil]] Championship runs on neat ethanol, E100.

Ethanol fuel may also be utilized as a [[rocket fuel]].  {{as of|2010}}, small quantities of ethanol are used in [[Light aircraft|lightweight]] [[Mark-III X-racer|rocket-racing aircraft]].<ref name=sdc20100426>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/rocket-racing-tulsa-demonstration-100426.html|title=Rocket Racing League Unveils New Flying Hot Rod|work=Space.com|accessdate=20 January 2015}}</ref>

==Replacement cooking fuel==
[[Project Gaia]] is a U.S. [[non-governmental]], [[non-profit]] organization involved in the creation of a commercially viable household market for alcohol-based fuels in Ethiopia and other countries in the [[developing world]]. The project considers alcohol fuels to be a solution to fuel shortages, environmental damage, and public health issues caused by traditional cooking in the developing world. Targeting poor and marginalized communities that face health issues from cooking over polluting fires, Gaia currently works in [[Ethiopia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Brazil]], [[Haiti]], and [[Madagascar]], and is in the planning stage of projects in several other countries.<ref name=""ceihd"">[http://ceihd.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&sectionid=6&id=50&ItemId=1 ""Impact of Improved Stoves and Fuels on IAP""], CEIHD Center for Entrepreneurship in International Health and Development.

2120798,2017-01-28 00:59:00-06,Lithium economy,"The '''lithium economy''' is a concept analogous to other element-based economies, such as the [[hydrogen economy]], [[methanol economy]], [[ethanol economy]], electron economy, [[vegetable oils as alternative energy|vegetable oil economy]], or [[liquid nitrogen economy]] but where the energy storage medium is [[lithium]]. Analogous ""economies"" are the ""aluminium economy"" where the energy storage medium (fuel) is aluminium (typically aluminium-gallium).

The hydrogen economy as a low-carbon solution to land transport has problems in generation, distribution (infrastructure), on-board storage and cost of power converter ([[fuel cell]]). The lithium economy has analogous problems in all four areas, but considered separately, the routes to their solution have different absolute limits and different timescales for their solutions.

The lithium economy concept is used primarily as a political argument to prevent over-domination of the post-carbon energy future by oil companies; and as a post-carbon economy on which action can be taken now instead of deferred to some future date (see [[FreedomCAR]] project).

The lithium economy differs from the other proposed future fuel economies in that the transition roadmap begins with conventional rechargeable batteries using conventional [[Lithium ion battery|Li-ion]] or [[Lithium ion polymer battery|Lithium polymer cell]] batteries and progressing to chemistries (such as [[Lithium sulfur battery|Li-S]] and [[Lithium iron phosphate battery|Li-iron-phosphate]]) and cell types with higher energy densities. Eventually, anode replacement Li-air or Li-water cells are envisaged where only anodes (lithium metal) are replaced.

The energy is stored in unoxidised lithium atoms, which release energy when oxidised. A lithium atom is seven times as heavy as a hydrogen atom, and at room temperature, hydrogen is a gas, while lithium is solid. This means energy per mass is much worse, but since lithium is much more compact, it has more energy per volume. In fact, storing hydrogen requires so much ancillary equipment or material that lithium is also competitive in energy per mass when the whole system is considered.","==See also==

55017,2017-08-28 19:24:00-05,Fusion power,"'''Fusion power''' is [[energy]] generated by [[nuclear fusion]], or, more specifically, the use of fusion reactions to produce heat for electricity generation. Fusion reactions fuse two lighter [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] to form a heavier nucleus, releasing energy.

The fusion reaction normally takes place in a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] of [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]] heated to millions of degrees. In stars gravity contains these ""fuels"". Outside of a star, the most researched way to confine the plasma at these temperatures while reactions take place is to use electric or magnetic fields. The major challenge in realising fusion power is to engineer a system that can confine the plasma long enough at high enough temperature and density.

As a source of power nuclear fusion has several theoretical advantages over [[nuclear fission|fission]]. These advantages include reduced [[radioactivity]] in operation and as waste, ample fuel supplies, and increased safety. However, controlled fusion has proven to be extremely difficult to produce in a practical and economic manner. Research into fusion reactors began in the 1940s, but {{asof|2017|lc=yes}}, no design has produced positive net energy.

Over the years, fusion researchers have investigated various confinement concepts. The early emphasis was on three main systems: [[z-pinch]], [[stellarator]] and [[magnetic mirror]]. The current leading designs are the [[tokamak]] and [[inertial confinement fusion|inertial confinement]] (ICF) by [[laser]]. Both designs are being built at very large scales, most notably the [[ITER]] tokamak in France, and the [[National Ignition Facility]] laser in the USA. Researchers are also studying other designs that may offer cheaper approaches. Among these alternatives there is increasing interest in [[magnetized target fusion]] and [[inertial electrostatic confinement]]. {{asof|2017}}, no system produces more energy than it requires to initiate and sustain a fusion reaction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Current-and-Future-Generation/Nuclear-Fusion-Power/|title=Nuclear Fusion : WNA|work=world-nuclear.org|date=November 2015}}</ref>

== Background ==
{{main article|Nuclear fusion}}
[[File:Binding energy curve - common isotopes.svg|thumb|300px|Binding energy for different atoms. Iron-56 has the highest, making it the most stable. Atoms to the left are likely to fuse; atoms to the right are likely to split.]]

=== Mechanism ===
Fusion reactions occur when two or more atomic nuclei come close enough for long enough that the [[nuclear force]] pulling them together exceeds the [[electrostatic force]] pushing them apart, fusing them into heavier nuclei. For nuclei lighter than [[iron-56]], the reaction is [[exothermic]], releasing energy. For nuclei heavier than iron-56, the reaction is [[endothermic]], requiring an external source of energy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nucene/nucbin.html#c2|title=Fission and fusion can yield energy|publisher=Hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu|accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref> Hence, nuclei smaller than iron-56 are more likely to fuse while those heavier than iron-56 are more likely to break apart.

The strong force acts only over short distances. The repulsive electrostatic force acts over longer distances. In order to undergo fusion, the fuel atoms need to be given enough energy to approach each other close enough for the strong force to become active. The amount of [[kinetic energy]] needed to bring the fuel atoms close enough is known as the ""[[Coulomb barrier]]"". Ways of providing this energy include speeding up atoms in a [[particle accelerator]], or heating them to high temperatures.

Once an atom is heated above its [[ionization]] energy, its [[electron]]s are stripped away (it is ionized), leaving just the bare nucleus (the [[ion]]). The result is a hot cloud of ions and the electrons formerly attached to them. This cloud is known as a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. Because the charges are separated, plasmas are electrically conductive and magnetically controllable. Many fusion devices take advantage of this to control the particles as they are heated.

=== Cross Section ===

[[File:fusion rxnrate.svg|right|300px|thumb|The fusion reaction rate increases rapidly with temperature until it maximizes and then gradually drops off. The deuterium-tritium fusion rate peaks at a lower temperature (about 70&nbsp;keV, or 800 million kelvin) and at a higher value than other reactions commonly considered for fusion energy.]]

A reaction's [[cross section (physics)|cross section]], denoted σ, is the measure of the probability that a fusion reaction will happen. This depends on the relative velocity of the two nuclei. Higher relative velocities generally increase the probability, but the probability begins to decrease again at very high energies. Cross sections for many fusion reactions were measured (mainly in the 1970s) using [[particle beam]]s.<ref name=""osti.gov"">{{cite journal|url=http://www.osti.gov/scitech/biblio/4014032 |last=Miley |first=G.H. |last2=Towner |first2=H. |last3=Ivich |first3=N. |title=SciTech Connect: Fusion cross sections and reactivities |doi=10.2172/4014032 |publisher=Osti.gov |date=1974-06-17 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}</ref>

In a plasma, particle velocity can be characterized using a probability distribution. If the plasma is thermalized, the distribution looks like a [[Gaussian function|bell curve]], or [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|maxwellian distribution]]. In this case, it is useful to use the average particle cross section over the velocity distribution. This is entered into the volumetric fusion rate:<ref name=""Lawson"">""Some Criteria for a Power producing thermonuclear reactor"" John Lawson, Atomic Energy Research Establishment, Hanvell, Berks, 2nd November 1956</ref>

:<math>P_\text{fusion} = n_A n_B \langle \sigma v_{A,B} \rangle E_\text{fusion}</math>

where:
* <math>P_\text{fusion}</math> is the energy made by fusion, per time and volume
* ''n'' is the number density of species A or B, of the particles in the volume
* <math>\langle \sigma v_{A,B} \rangle</math> is the cross section of that reaction, average over all the velocities of the two species ''v''
* <math>E_\text{fusion}</math> is the energy released by that fusion reaction.

=== Lawson Criterion ===

The Lawson Criterion shows how energy output varies with temperature, density, speed of collision, and fuel. This equation was central to John Lawson's analysis of fusion working with a hot plasma. Lawson assumed an [[First law of thermodynamics|energy balance]], shown below.<ref name=""Lawson""/>

:<math>P_\text{out} = \eta_\text{capture}\left(P_\text{fusion} - P_\text{conduction} - P_\text{radiation}\right)</math>

* ''η'', efficiency
* <math>P_\text{conduction}</math>, conduction losses as energy laden mass leaves
* <math>P_\text{radiation}</math>, radiation losses as energy leaves as light
* <math>P_\text{out}</math>, net power from fusion
* <math>P_\text{fusion}</math>, is rate of energy generated by the fusion reactions.

Plasma clouds lose energy through [[Thermal conduction|conduction]] and [[radiation]].<ref name=""Lawson""/> Conduction occurs when [[ion]]s, [[electron]]s or [[neutral particle|neutrals]] impact other substances, typically a surface of the device, and transfer a portion of their kinetic energy to the other atoms. Radiation is energy that leaves the cloud as light in the visible, [[UV]], [[Ionizing radiation|IR]], or [[X-ray]] spectra. Radiation increases with temperature. Fusion power technologies must overcome these losses.

=== Triple product: density, temperature, time ===

The Lawson criterion argues that a machine holding a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|thermalized]] and quasi-[[Neutral particle|neutral]] plasma has to meet basic criteria to overcome [[radiation]] losses, [[conduction (heat)|conduction]] losses and reach efficiency of 30 percent.<ref name=""Lawson""/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.efda.org/2013/02/triple-product/ |title=Lawson’s three criteria |publisher=EFDA |date=February 25, 2013 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}</ref> This became known as the ""triple product"": the plasma density, temperature and confinement time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.efda.org/glossary/triple-product/ |title=Triple product |publisher=EFDA |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}</ref> Attempts to increase the triple product led to targeting larger plants. Larger plants move structural materials further away from the centre of the plasma, which reduces conduction and radiation losses since more of the radiation is internally reflected. This emphasis on <math>(n T \tau)</math> as a metric of success has impacted other considerations such as cost, size, complexity and efficiency.{{dubious|there's zero ""efficiency"" unless fusion is reached, and experimental scientists are unlikely to put an abstract number above actual results, if they don't believe it is the decisive quantity to achieve fusion|date=October 2014}} This has led to larger, more complicated and more expensive machines such as [[ITER]] and [[National Ignition Facility|NIF]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

=== Plasma behavior ===

Plasma is an ionized gas that conducts electricity.<ref>{{cite book|title=Introduction to Plasma Physics|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Richard|chapter=Magnetized plasma}}</ref> In bulk, it is modeled using [[magnetohydrodynamics]], which is a combination of the [[Navier-Stokes]] equations governing fluids and [[Maxwell's equations]] governing how [[magnetic]] and [[electric fields]] behave.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Alfvén | first1 = H | year = 1942 | title = Existence of electromagnetic-hydrodynamic waves | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 150 | issue = | pages = 405–406 | doi = 10.1038/150405d0 | bibcode=1942Natur.150..405A }}</ref> Fusion exploits several plasma properties, including:

Self-organizing plasma conducts electric and magnetic fields. Its motions can generate fields that can in turn contain it.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tuszewski | first1 = M. | year = 1988 | title = Field reversed configurations | url = | journal = Nuclear Fusion | volume = 28 | issue = 11| pages = 2033–2092 | doi = 10.1088/0029-5515/28/11/008 }}</ref>

[[Diamagnetism|Diamagnetic plasma]] can generate its own internal magnetic field. This can reject an externally applied magnetic field, making it diamagnetic.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Is a Plasma Diamagnetic?|url = http://physicsessays.org/doi/abs/10.4006/1.3025762|journal = Physics Essays|date = 2005-01-01|volume = 18|issue = 4|doi = 10.4006/1.3025762|first = W.|last = Engelhardt|arxiv = physics/0510139 |bibcode = 2005PhyEs..18..504E|pages=504–513}}{{dead link|date=May 2016}}</ref>

[[Magnetic mirror]]s can reflect plasma when it moves from a low to high density field.<ref>R. F. Post, Proc. of Second U.N. Int. Conf. on Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, Vol. 32, p. 245 (Geneva, 1958)</ref>

=== Energy capture ===
Multiple approaches have been proposed for energy capture. The simplest is to heat a fluid. Most designs concentrate on the D-T reaction, which releases much of its energy in a neutron. Electrically neutral, the neutron escapes the confinement. In most such designs, it is ultimately captured in a thick ""blanket"" of [[lithium]] surrounding the reactor core. When struck by a high-energy neutron, the lithium can produce tritium, which is then fed back into the reactor. The energy of this reaction also heats the blanket, which is then actively cooled with a working fluid and then that fluid is used to drive conventional turbomachinery.

It has also been proposed to use the neutrons to breed additional fission fuel in a blanket of [[nuclear waste]], a concept known as a [[fission-fusion hybrid]]. In these systems, the power output is enhanced by the fission events, and power is extracted using systems like those in conventional fission reactors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://life.llnl.gov/ |title=Laser Inertial Fusion Energy |publisher=Life.llnl.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915170021/https://life.llnl.gov/ |archivedate=2014-09-15 }}</ref>

Designs that use other fuels, notably the p-B reaction, release much more of their energy in the form of charged particles. In these cases, alternate power extraction systems based on the movement of these charges are possible. [[Direct energy conversion]] was developed at [[LLNL]] in the 1980s as a method to maintain a voltage using the  fusion reaction products. This has demonstrated energy capture efficiency of 48 percent.<ref name=""ReferenceA"">""Experimental results from a beam direct converter at 100 kV"" R. W. MOIR, W. L. BARR, ''Journal of fusion energy'', Volume 2, No 2, 1982</ref>

== Approaches ==

=== Magnetic confinement  ===
''[[Tokamak]]:'' the most well-developed and well-funded approach to fusion energy. This method races hot plasma around in a magnetically confined, donut-shaped ring, with an internal current. When completed, [[ITER]] will be the world's largest tokamak. As of April 2012 an estimated 215 experimental tokamaks were either planned, decommissioned or currently operating (35) worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tokamak.info/|title=All-the-Worlds-Tokamaks|work=tokamak.info}}</ref>

''[[Spherical tokamak]]:'' also known as ''spherical torus'' A variation on the tokamak with a spherical shape.

''[[Stellarator]]:'' Twisted rings of hot plasma. The stellarator attempts to create a natural twist plasma path, using external magnets, while tokamaks create those magnetic fields using an internal current. Stellarators were developed by [[Lyman Spitzer]] in 1950 and have four designs: Torsatron, Heliotron, Heliac and Helias. One example is [[Wendelstein 7-X]], a German fusion device that produced its first plasma on December 10, 2015. It is the world's largest stellarator,<ref>[http://www.ipp.mpg.de/3984226/12_15 First plasma in Wendelstein 7-X | Max-Planck-Institut für Plasmaphysik]</ref> designed to investigate the suitability of this type of device for a power station.

''[[Levitated dipole|Levitated Dipole Experiment (LDX)]]:'' These use a solid superconducting torus. This is magnetically levitated inside the reactor chamber. The superconductor forms an axisymmetric magnetic field that contains the plasma. The LDX was developed by MIT and Columbia University after 2000 by Jay Kesner and Michael E. Mauel.<ref>""MIT tests unique approach to fusion power"". MIT News, David Chandler, MIT News Office, March 19, 2008. Accessed March 2008</ref>

''[[Magnetic mirror]]:'' Developed by [[Richard F. Post]] and teams at [[LLNL]] in the 1960s.<ref name=""Mirror Systems 1969"">""Mirror Systems: Fuel Cycles, loss reduction and energy recovery"" by Richard F. Post, BNES Nuclear fusion reactor conferences at Culham laboratory, September 1969.</ref> Magnetic mirrors reflected hot plasma back and forth in a line. Variations included the [[Tandem Mirror Experiment|Tandem Mirror]], magnetic bottle and the [[biconic cusp]].<ref>J Berowitz, H Grad and H Rubin, in proceedings of the second United Nations International conference on peaceful uses of atomic energy, Geneva, 1958, Vol 31, Page 177</ref> A series of well-funded, large, mirror machines were built by the US government in the 1970s and 1980s, principally at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]].<ref>P.A. Bagryansky et. al., Physical Review Letters 114, 205001 (2015)</ref>

''[[Bumpy torus]]:'' A number of magnetic mirrors are arranged end-to-end in a toroidal ring. Any fuel ions that leak out of one are confined in a neighboring mirror, permitting the plasma pressure to be raised arbitrarily high without loss. An experimental facility, the '''ELMO''' '''B'''umpy '''T'''orus or '''EBT''' was built and tested at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the 1970s.

''[[Field-reversed configuration]]:'' This device traps plasma in a self-organized quasi-stable structure; where the particle motion makes an internal magnetic field which then traps itself.<ref name=""Freidberg2007"">{{cite book|first=Jeffrey P. |last=Freidberg|title=Plasma Physics and Fusion Energy|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=ZGU-ngEACAAJ}}|date=8 February 2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85107-7}}</ref>

''[[Spheromak]]:'' Very similar to a field reversed configuration, a semi-stable plasma structure made by using the plasmas' own self-generated magnetic field.  A spheromak has both a toroidal and poloidal fields, while a Field Reversed Configuration only has no toroidal field.<ref>""Magnetic Fusion Technology"" Thomas Dolan, et Al, Springer, 2014 Chapter 1, pages 30 - 40</ref>

''[[Reversed field pinch]]:'' Here the plasma moves inside a ring. It has an internal magnetic field. Moving out from the center of this ring, the magnetic field reverses direction.

=== Inertial confinement ===

''[[Inertial confinement fusion|Direct drive]]:'' In this technique, lasers directly blast a pellet of fuel. The goal is to ignite a fusion chain reaction. Ignition was first suggested by John Nuckolls, in 1972.<ref name=""Nuckolls, John 1972"">{{cite journal | last1 = Nuckolls | first1 = John | last2 = Wood | first2 = Lowell | last3 = Thiessen | first3 = Albert | last4 = Zimmerman | first4 = George | year = 1972 | title = Laser Compression of Matter to Super-High Densities: Thermonuclear (CTR) Applications | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 239 | issue = | pages = 139–142 | doi = 10.1038/239139a0 |bibcode = 1972Natur.239..139N }}</ref> Notable direct drive experiments have been conducted at the [[Laboratory for Laser Energetics]], [[Laser Mégajoule]] and the [[GEKKO XII]] facilities. Good implosions require fuel pellets with close to a perfect shape in order to generate a symmetrical inward [[shock wave]] that produces the high-density plasma.

''Fast ignition:'' This method uses two laser blasts. The first blast compresses the fusion fuel, while the second high energy pulse ignites it. Experiments have been conducted at the [[Laboratory for Laser Energetics]] using the Omega and Omega EP systems and at the GEKKO XII laser at the Institute for Laser Engineering in Osaka Japan.

''[[Inertial confinement fusion|Indirect drive]]:'' In this technique, lasers blasts a structure around the pellet of fuel. This structure is known as a [[Hohlraum]]. As it disintegrates the pellet is bathed in a more uniform [[x-ray]] light, creating better compression. The largest system using this method is the [[National Ignition Facility]].

''[[Magneto-inertial fusion]]'' or ''[[Magnetized Liner Inertial Fusion]]:'' This combines a laser pulse with a magnetic pinch. The pinch community refers to it as magnetized liner Inertial fusion while the ICF community refers to it as magneto-inertial fusion.<ref name=""IFSA2007"">{{cite web|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/1742-6596/112/4/042084/pdf/jpconf8_112_042084.pdf|format=PDF|title= Status of the U. S. program in magneto-inertial fusion|author=Y. C. Francis Thio Ph.D., Program Manager, U. S. Department of Energy, Office of Fusion Energy Sciences, Germantown, Maryland, United States|publisher=Iopscience.iop.org|accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref>

''Heavy Ion Beams'' There are also proposals to do inertial confinement fusion with ion beams instead of laser beams.<ref>INERTIAL FUSION DRIVEN BY INTENSE HEAVY-ION BEAMS, W. M. Sharp, et al, 2011</ref> The main difference is the mass of the beam has momentum, whereas lasers do not.

=== Magnetic or electric pinches ===
{{Main article|Pinch (plasma physics)}}''[[Z-Pinch]]:'' This method sends a strong current (in the z-direction) through the plasma. The current generates a magnetic field that squeezes the plasma to fusion conditions. Pinches were the first method for man-made controlled fusion.<ref name=""Seife, Charles 2008"">Seife, Charles. Sun in a Bottle: The Strange History of Fusion and the Science of Wishful Thinking. 1st ed. Vol. 1. N.p.: Penguin, 2008. Print.</ref><ref name=""Phillips, James 2013"">Phillips, James. ""Magnetic Fusion."" Los Alamos Science Winter 1983: 64-67. Web. 4 Apr. 2013.</ref> Some examples include the [[Dense plasma focus]] and the [[Z Pulsed Power Facility|Z machine]] at [[Sandia National Laboratories]].

''Theta-Pinch:'' This method sends a current inside a plasma, in the theta direction.

''Screw Pinch:'' This method combines a theta and z-pinch for improved stabilization.<ref>Srivastava, K. M.; Vyas, D. N., ""Non-linear analysis of the stability of the screw pinch"", (1982) Astrophysics and Space Science, vol. 86, no. 1, Aug. 1982, p. 71-89</ref>

=== Inertial electrostatic confinement ===
{{Main|Inertial Electrostatic Confinement}}

''[[Fusor]]:'' This method uses an electric field to heat ions to fusion conditions. The machine typically uses two spherical cages, a cathode inside the anode, inside a vacuum. These machines are not considered a viable approach to net power because of their high [[Electrical conductor|conduction]] and [[radiation]]<ref>""A general critique of inertial-electrostatic confinement fusion systems"" Plasma Physics, June 1995, Dr. Todd Rider, MIT</ref> losses. They are simple enough to build that amateurs have fused atoms using them.<ref>""The Boy Who Played With Fusion"". Popular Science. Retrieved October 18, 2013.</ref>

''[[Polywell]]:'' This design attempts to combine magnetic confinement with electrostatic fields, to avoid the [[Electrical conductor|conduction]] losses generated by the cage.<ref>US patent 5,160,695, Robert W. Bussard, ""Method and apparatus for creating and controlling nuclear fusion reactions"", issued 1992-11-03</ref>

=== Other ===
''[[Magnetized target fusion]]:'' This method confines hot plasma using a magnetic field and squeezes it using inertia. Examples include [[LANL]] FRX-L machine,<ref>FRX-L: A Plasma Injector for Magnetized Target Fusion</ref> [[General Fusion]] and the plasma liner experiment.<ref>""Spherically imploding plasma liners as a standoff driver for MIF"" IEEE transactions, 2012, Hsu, et al.</ref>

''[[Cluster impact fusion|Cluster Impact Fusion]]'' Microscopic droplets of heavy water are accelerated at great velocity into a target or into one another. Researchers at Brookhaven reported positive results which were later refuted by further experimentation. Fusion effects were actually produced because of contamination of the droplets.

''[[Project PACER|Uncontrolled]]:'' Fusion has been initiated by man, using uncontrolled fission explosions to ignite so-called Hydrogen Bombs. Early proposals for fusion power included using bombs to initiate reactions.

''Beam fusion:'' A beam of high energy particles can be fired at another beam or target and fusion will occur. This was used in the 1970s and 1980s to study the cross sections of high energy fusion reactions.<ref name=""osti.gov""/>

''[[Bubble fusion]]:'' This was a fusion reaction that was supposed to occur inside extraordinarily large collapsing gas bubbles, created during acoustic liquid cavitation.<ref>Chang, Kenneth (February 27, 2007). ""Practical Fusion, or Just a Bubble?"". New York Times. Retrieved 2007-02-27. ""Dr. Putterman's approach is to use sound waves, called sonofusion or bubble fusion, to expand and collapse tiny bubbles, generating ultrahot temperatures. At temperatures hot enough, atoms can literally fuse and release even more energy than when they split in nuclear fission, now used in nuclear power stations and weapons.

''[[Cold fusion]]:'' This is a hypothetical type of nuclear reaction that would occur at, or near, room temperature. Cold fusion is discredited and gained a reputation as [[pathological science]].<ref>Chang, Kenneth (2004-03-25), US will give cold fusion a second look, The New York Times, retrieved 2009-02-08.</ref><ref>Ouellette, Jennifer (2011-12-23), Could Starships Use Cold Fusion Propulsion?, Discovery News.</ref>

''[[Muon-catalyzed fusion]]:'' Muons allow atoms to get much closer and thus reduce the kinetic energy required to initiate fusion. Muons require more energy to produce than can be obtained from muon-catalysed fusion, making this approach impractical for power generation.<ref name=""Huizenga1993"">{{cite book|first=John Robert |last=Huizenga|title=Cold Fusion: The Scientific Fiasco of the Century|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=WFgYAQAAMAAJ}}|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-855817-0}}</ref>

''[[Space-based solar power|Gravitational-confinement fusion (GCF) Direct Photo-Electric Conversion]]:'' Also known as [[Space-based solar power|Space-Based Solar Power]] argues that a majority of available fusion fuels exists within the sphere of the Sun where it is gravitationally confined, and that a tractable way to accomplish large-scale fusion power is to build very large space-borne platforms that capture energy via photons rather than via a [[carnot cycle]].  The theoretical limit of producing power by such means is a [[Kardashev scale|type-2 civilization]] using a [[Dyson sphere|Dyson Sphere.]]

== Common tools ==

=== Heating ===
Gas is heated to form a plasma hot enough to start fusion reactions. A number of heating schemes have been explored:<ref>""NEUTRAL-BEAM INJECTION"" W. B. Kunkel, Lawrence Livermore National Labs, FUSION, 1980</ref>

''[[Dielectric heating|Radiofrequency Heating]]'' A radio wave is applied to the plasma, causing it to oscillate. This is basically the same concept as a [[microwave oven]]. This is also known as [[electron cyclotron resonance heating]] or [[Dielectric heating]]{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}.

''[[Inertial electrostatic confinement|Electrostatic Heating]]'' An electric field can do [[work (thermodynamics)|work]] on charged ions or electrons, heating them.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}.

''[[Neutral Beam Injection]]'' An external source of hydrogen is ionized and accelerated by an electric field to form a charged beam which is shone through a source of neutral hydrogen gas towards the plasma which itself is ionized and contained in the reactor by a magnetic field. Some of the intermediate hydrogen gas is accelerated towards the plasma by collisions with the charged beam while remaining neutral: this neutral beam is thus unaffected by the magnetic field and so shines through it into the plasma. Once inside the plasma the neutral beam transmits energy to the plasma by collisions as a result of which it becomes ionized and thus contained by the magnetic field thereby both heating and refuelling the reactor in one operation. The remainder of the charged beam is diverted by magnetic fields onto cooled beam dumps.

''Antiproton annihilation'' Theoretically a quantity of antiprotons injected into a mass of fusion fuel can induce thermonuclear reactions. This possibility as a method of spacecraft propulsion, known as [[Antimatter-catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion]], was investigated at [[Pennsylvania State University]] in connection with the proposed [[AIMStar]] project.

=== Measurement ===
''[[Thomson Scattering]]'' Light scatters from plasma. This light can be detected and used to reconstruct the plasmas' behavior. This technique can be used to find its density and temperature. It is common in [[Inertial confinement fusion]],<ref>""Nonlinear Thomson scattering of intense laser pulses from beams and plasma"" Phys. Rev. E 48, 3003 – Published 1 October 1993 Eric Esarey, Sally K. Ride, and Phillip Sprangle</ref> [[Tokamak]]s<ref>""Thomson scattering system on the TEXTOR tokamak using a multi-pass laser beam configuration"" M Yu Kantor, A J H Donné, R Jaspers, Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion, Volume 51, 5</ref> and [[fusor]]s. In ICF systems, this can be done by firing a second beam into a gold foil adjacent to the target. This makes x-rays that scatter or traverse the plasma. In Tokamaks, this can be done using mirrors and detectors to reflect light across a plane (two dimensions) or in a line (one dimension).

''[[Langmuir probe]]'' This is a metal object placed in a plasma. A potential is applied to it, giving it a positive or negative [[voltage]] against the surrounding plasma. The metal collects charged particles, drawing a current. As the voltage changes, the current changes. This makes a [[Current–voltage characteristic|IV Curve]]. The IV-curve can be used to determine the local plasma density, potential and temperature.<ref>Mott-Smith, H. M. and Langmuir, Irving (1926). ""The Theory of Collectors in Gaseous Discharges"". Phys. Rev. 28 (4): 727–763.</ref>

''[[Neutron detection|Neutron detectors]]'' Deuterium or tritium fusion produces neutrons. [[Neutron detection#Classic neutron detection options|Neutrons interact with surrounding matter in ways that can be detected.]] [[Neutron detection#Types of neutron detectors|Several types of neutron detectors exist]] which can record the rate at which neutrons are produced during fusion reactions. They are an essential tool for demonstrating success.

''[[Flux loop]]'' A loop of wire is inserted into the magnetic field. As the field passes through the loop, a current is made. The current is measured and used to find the total magnetic flux through that loop. This has been used on the [[National Compact Stellarator Experiment]],<ref>""NCSX Vacuum Vessel External Flux Loops Design and Installation, PPPL, Twenty-Second Symposium on Fusion Engineering, 2007

''[[X-ray detector]]'' All plasma loses energy by emitting light. This covers the whole spectrum: visible, IR, UV, and X-rays. This occurs anytime a particle changes speed, [[Larmor formula|for any reason.]]<ref>J. Larmor, ""On a dynamical theory of the electric and luminiferous medium"", Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society 190, (1897) pp. 205–300 (Third and last in a series of papers with the same name).</ref> If the reason is deflection by a magnetic field, the radiation is [[Cyclotron]] radiation at low speeds and [[Synchrotron]] radiation at high speeds. If the reason is deflection by another particle, plasma radiates X-rays, known as [[Bremsstrahlung]] radiation. X-rays are termed in both hard and soft, based on their energy.

=== Power production ===
''[[Steam turbine]]s'' It has been proposed <ref>""Study of steam, helium and supercritical CO2 turbine power generations in prototype fusion power reactor"", S Ishiyama, Y Muto, Y Kato, S Nishio, Progress in Nuclear Fusion, 2008</ref> that steam turbines be used to convert the heat from the fusion chamber into electricity. The heat is transferred into a [[working fluid]] that turns into steam, driving electric generators.

''Neutron blankets'' Deuterium and tritium fusion generates [[neutron]]s. This varies by technique (NIF has a record of 3E14 neutrons per second<ref>{{cite web|last1=Seaver|first1=Lynda L|title=Press release: World's largest laser sets records for neutron yield and laser energy|url=https://www.llnl.gov/news/worlds-largest-laser-sets-records-neutron-yield-and-laser-energy|publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|language=en|date=8 November 2010}}</ref> while a typical [[fusor]] produces 1E5–1E9 neutrons per second).

''[[Direct energy conversion|Direct conversion]]'' This is a method where the [[kinetic energy]] of a particle is converted into [[voltage]].<ref>""Mirror Systems: Fuel Cycles, loss reduction and energy recovery"" by Richard F. Post, BNES Nuclear fusion reactor conferences at Culham laboratory, September 1969</ref> It was first suggested by [[Richard F. Post]] in conjunction with [[magnetic mirror]]s, in the late sixties. It has also been suggested for [[Field-Reversed Configuration]]s. The process takes the plasma, expands it, and converts a large fraction of the random energy of the fusion products into directed motion. The particles are then collected on electrodes at various large electrical potentials. This method has demonstrated an experimental efficiency of 48 percent.<ref>""Test results on plasma direct converters"" William L. Barr and Ralph W Moir, Nuclear Technology Vol 3, January 1983</ref>

== Records ==
Fusion records have been set by a number of devices.  Here are some:

=== Q ===
The ratio of energy extracted against the amount of energy supplied.  This record is considered to be set by the Joint European Torus in 1997 when the device extracted 16 MW of power.<ref name=ccfe>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccfe.ac.uk/jet.aspx|title=JET|publisher=Culham Centre Fusion Energy|accessdate=26 June 2016}}</ref> However, this ratio can be seen three different ways.
* 0.69 is the actual point in time ratio between ”fusion power”  and actual input power in the plasma (23 MW).
* 0.069  is the ratio between the “fusion”  power and the power required to produce the 23MW input power  (essentially it takes into account the efficiency of the NB system).
* 0.0069 is the ratio between the “fusion”  power and the total peak power required for a JET pulse. This takes into account all the power from the grid plus the one from the two large JET flywheel generators.

=== Runtime ===
In [[tokamak]]s, the longest runtime is 29 hours, set by the fusion startup Tokamak Energy on July 6, 2016.<ref>http://www.tokamakenergy.co.uk/we-now-hold-the-world-record-for-running-our-tokamak-with-magnets-of-high-temperature-superconductors-for-29-hours/</ref> 
In Field Reversed Configurations, the longest run time is 300 ms, set by the Princeton Field Reversed Configuration in August 2016.<ref>Cohen, Sam, and B. Berlinger. ""Long-pulse Operation of the PFRC-2 Device."" The Joint US-Japan Compact Torus. Wisconsin, Madison. 22 Aug. 2016. Lecture.</ref> However this involved no fusion.  The record with fusion is 11 ms and was set by the fusion startup [[Tri Alpha Energy]].

== Confinement ==
[[File:IFE and MFE parameter space.svg|thumb|right|250px|Parameter space occupied by [[inertial fusion energy]] and [[magnetic fusion energy]] devices as of the mid 1990s. The regime allowing thermonuclear ignition with high gain lies near the upper right corner of the plot.]]

Confinement refers to all the conditions necessary to keep a plasma dense and hot long enough to undergo fusion. Here are some general principles.

*[[Mechanical equilibrium|Equilibrium]]: The forces acting on the plasma must be balanced for containment. One exception is [[inertial confinement fusion|inertial confinement]], where the relevant physics must occur faster than the disassembly time.
*[[Plasma stability|Stability]]: The plasma must be so constructed so that disturbances will not lead to the plasma disassembling.
*Transport or [[conduction (heat)|conduction]]: The loss of material must be sufficiently slow.<ref name=""Lawson""/> The plasma carries off energy with it, so rapid loss of material will disrupt any machines power balance. Material can be lost by transport into different regions or [[conduction (heat)|conduction]] through a solid or liquid.

To produce self-sustaining fusion, the energy released by the reaction (or at least a fraction of it) must be used to heat new reactant nuclei and keep them hot long enough that they also undergo fusion reactions.

=== Unconfined ===
The first human-made, large-scale fusion reaction was the test of the [[hydrogen bomb]], [[Ivy Mike]], in 1952. As part of the [[PACER (fusion)|PACER]] project, it was once proposed to use hydrogen bombs as a source of power by detonating them in underground caverns and then generating electricity from the heat produced, but such a power station is unlikely ever to be constructed.

=== Magnetic confinement ===
At the temperatures required for fusion, the fuel is heated to a plasma state. In this state it has a very good [[electrical conductivity]]. This opens the possibility of confining the plasma with [[magnetic field]], generally known as [[magnetic confinement fusion|magnetic confinement]]. The field lines put a [[Lorentz force]] on the plasma. The force works perpendicular to the magnetic fields, so one problem in magnetic confinement is preventing the plasma from leaking out the ends of the field lines. A general measure of magnetic trapping in fusion is the beta ratio:

<math>\beta = \frac{p}{p_{mag}} = \frac{n k_B T}{(B^2/2\mu_0)}</math> <ref>Wesson, J: ""Tokamaks"", 3rd edition page 115, Oxford University Press, 2004</ref>

This is the ratio of the externally applied field to the internal pressure of the plasma. A value of 1 is ideal trapping. Some examples of beta values include:

''Magnetic Mirror'' One example of magnetic confinement is with the [[magnetic mirror]] effect. If a particle follows the field line and enters a region of higher field strength, the particles can be reflected. There are several devices that try to use this effect. The most famous was the magnetic mirror machines, which was a series of large, expensive devices built at the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] from the 1960s to mid 1980s.<ref>Booth, William. ""Fusion's $372-Million Mothball."" Science [New York City] 9 Oct. 1987, Volume 238 ed.: 152-55. Print</ref> Some other examples include the magnetic bottles and [[Biconic cusp]].<ref>Containment in a cusped Plasma System, Dr. Harold Grad, NYO-9496</ref> Because the mirror machines were straight, they had some advantages over a ring shape. First, mirrors were easier to construct and maintain and second [[Direct energy conversion|direct conversion]] energy capture, was easier to implement.<ref name=""ReferenceA""/> As the confinement achieved in experiments was poor, this approach was abandoned.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

''Magnetic Loops'' Another example of magnetic confinement is to bend the field lines back on themselves, either in circles or more commonly in nested [[torus|toroidal]] surfaces. The most highly developed system of this type is the ''[[tokamak]]'', with the ''[[stellarator]]'' being next most advanced, followed by the [[Reversed field pinch]]. [[Compact toroid]]s, especially the ''[[Field-Reversed Configuration]]'' and the [[spheromak]], attempt to combine the advantages of toroidal magnetic surfaces with those of a [[simply connected space|simply connected]] (non-toroidal) machine, resulting in a mechanically simpler and smaller confinement area.

=== Inertial confinement ===
[[inertial confinement fusion|Inertial confinement]] is the use of rapidly imploding shell to heat and confine plasma. The shell is imploded using a direct laser blast (direct drive) or a secondary x-ray blast (indirect drive) or heavy ion beams. Theoretically, fusion using lasers would be done using tiny pellets of fuel that explode several times a second. To induce the explosion, the pellet must be compressed to about 30 times solid density with energetic beams. If direct drive is used—the beams are focused directly on the pellet—it can in principle be very efficient, but in practice is difficult to obtain the needed uniformity.{{sfn|Pfalzner|2006|p=19–20}} The alternative approach, indirect drive, uses beams to heat a shell, and then the shell radiates [[x-rays]], which then implode the pellet. The beams are commonly laser beams, but heavy and light [[ion beam]]s and electron beams have all been investigated.{{sfn|Pfalzner|2006|p182–193}}

=== Electrostatic confinement ===
There are also [[Inertial electrostatic confinement|electrostatic confinement fusion]] devices. These devices confine [[ion]]s using electrostatic fields. The best known is the [[Fusor]]. This device has a cathode inside an anode wire cage. Positive ions fly towards the negative inner cage, and are heated by the electric field in the process. If they miss the inner cage they can collide and fuse. Ions typically hit the cathode, however, creating prohibitory high [[conduction (heat)|conduction]] losses. Also, fusion rates in [[fusor]]s are very low because of competing physical effects, such as energy loss in the form of light radiation.<ref name=""Thorson1996"">{{cite book|first=Timothy A. |last=Thorson|title=Ion flow and fusion reactivity characterization of a spherically convergent ion focus|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=k6zVAAAAMAAJ}}|year=1996|publisher=University of Wisconsin, Madison}}</ref> Designs have been proposed to avoid the problems associated with the cage, by generating the field using a non-neutral cloud. These include a plasma oscillating device,<ref>""Stable, thermal equilibrium, large-amplitude, spherical plasma oscillations in electrostatic confinement devices"", DC Barnes and Rick Nebel, PHYSICS OF PLASMAS VOLUME 5, NUMBER 7 JULY 1998</ref> a [http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.01788 magnetically-shielded-grid] a [[penning trap]] and the [[polywell]].<ref>Carr, M.; Khachan, J.

== History of research ==
{{see also | Timeline of nuclear fusion}}
{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}

=== 1920s ===
Research into nuclear fusion started in the early part of the 20th century. In 1920 the British physicist [[Francis William Aston]] discovered that the total mass equivalent of four [[hydrogen atom]]s (two protons and two neutrons) are heavier than the total mass of one [[helium atom]] ([[Helium-4|He-4]]), which implied that net energy can be released by combining hydrogen atoms together to form helium, and provided the first hints of a mechanism by which stars could produce energy in the quantities being measured. Through the 1920s, [[Arthur Stanley Eddington]] became a major proponent of the [[proton–proton chain reaction]] (PP reaction) as the primary system running the [[Sun]].

=== 1930s ===
Neutrons from fusion was first detected by staff members at [[Ernest Rutherford]]s' at the [[University of Cambridge]], in 1933.<ref>Cockburn, Stewart; Ellyard, David (1981). Oliphant, the Life and Times of Sir Mark Oliphant. Adelaide: Axiom Books. {{ISBN|978-0-9594164-0-4}}.</ref>  The experiment was developed by [[Mark Oliphant]] and involved the acceleration of an protons towards a target {{sfn|Cockburn|Ellyard|1981|pp=48–50}} at energies of up to 600,000 electron volts. In 1933, the Cavendish Laboratory received a gift from the American [[physical chemist]] [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] of a few drops of [[heavy water]]. The accelerator was used to fire [[heavy hydrogen]] nuclei ''[[deuteron]]s'' at various targets. Working with Rutherford and others, Oliphant discovered the nuclei of [[Helium-3]] (''helions'') and [[tritium]] (''tritons'').{{sfn|Cockburn|Ellyard|1981|pp=52–55}}<ref>{{cite journal |first=M. L.

A theory was verified by [[Hans Bethe]] in 1939 showing that [[beta decay]] and [[quantum tunneling]] in the [[solar core|Sun's core]] might convert one of the protons into a [[neutron]] and thereby producing [[deuterium]] rather than a diproton. The deuterium would then fuse through other reactions to further increase the energy output. For this work, Bethe won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]].

=== 1940s ===
In 1942, nuclear fusion research was subsumed into the [[Manhattan Project]] when the [[secrecy]] surrounding the field obscured by the science. The first patent related to a fusion reactor was registered in 1946<ref>{{cite web|url=http://v3.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&IDX=GB817681&F=0 |title=British Patent 817681 |publisher=V3.espacenet.com |accessdate=2013-06-22}}</ref> by the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]]. The inventors were [[George Paget Thomson|Sir George Paget Thomson]] and [[Moses Blackman]]. This was the first detailed examination of the [[Z-pinch]] concept.

Z-pinch is based on the fact that plasmas are electrically conducting. Running a current through the plasma, will generate a magnetic field around the plasma. This field will, according to [[Lenz's law]], create an inward directed force that causes the plasma to collapse inward, raising its density. Denser plasmas generate denser magnetic fields, increasing the inward force, leading to a [[chain reaction]]. If the conditions are correct, this can lead to the densities and temperatures needed for fusion. The difficulty is getting the current into the plasma, which would normally melt any sort of mechanical [[electrode]]. A solution emerges again because of the conducting nature of the plasma; by placing the plasma in the middle of an [[electromagnet]], [[Electromagnetic induction|induction]] can be used to generate the current.

Starting in 1947, two UK teams carried out small experiments and began building a series of ever-larger experiments. When the Huemul results hit the news (see below), [[James L. Tuck]], a UK physicist working at Los Alamos, introduced the pinch concept in the US and produced a series of machines known as the [[Perhapsatron]]. The Soviet Union, unbeknownst to the West, was also building a series of similar machines. All of these devices quickly demonstrated a series of instabilities when the pinch was applied. This broke up the plasma column long before it reached the densities and temperatures required for fusion.

=== 1950s ===
[[File:IvyMike2.jpg|thumb|300px|The first man-made device to achieve [[Fusion gain factor|ignition]] was the detonation of this fusion device, codenamed [[Ivy Mike]].]]
[[File:Kink instability at Aldermaston.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Early photo of plasma inside a pinch machine (imperial college 1950/1951)]]

The first successful man-made fusion device was the [[boosted fission weapon]] tested in 1951 in the [[Greenhouse Item]] test. This was followed by true fusion weapons in 1952's [[Ivy Mike]], and the first practical examples in 1954's [[Castle Bravo]]. This was uncontrolled fusion. In these devices, the energy released by the fission explosion is used to compress and heat fusion fuel, starting a fusion reaction. Fusion releases [[neutron]]s. These [[neutron]]s hit the surrounding fission fuel, causing the atoms to split apart much faster than normal fission processes—almost instantly by comparison. This increases the effectiveness of bombs: normal fission weapons blow themselves apart before all their fuel is used; fusion/fission weapons do not have this practical upper limit.

In 1949 an expatriate German, [[Ronald Richter]], proposed the [[Huemul Project]] in Argentina, announcing positive results in 1951. These turned out to be fake, but it prompted considerable interest in the concept as a whole. In particular, it prompted [[Lyman Spitzer]] to begin considering ways to solve some of the more obvious problems involved in confining a hot plasma, and, unaware of the z-pinch efforts, he developed a new solution to the problem known as the [[stellarator]]. Spitzer applied to the US [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] for funding to build a test device. During this period, [[James L. Tuck|Jim Tuck]] who had worked with the UK teams had been introducing the z-pinch concept to his coworkers at his new job at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] (LANL). When he heard of Spitzer's pitch for funding, he applied to build a machine of his own, the [[Perhapsatron]].

Spitzer's idea won funding and he began work on the stellarator under the code name Project Matterhorn. His work led to the creation of the [[Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory]]. Tuck returned to LANL and arranged local funding to build his machine. By this time, however, it was clear that all of the pinch machines were suffering from the same issues involving stability, and progress stalled. In 1953, Tuck and others suggested a number of solutions to the stability problems. This led to the design of a second series of pinch machines, led by the UK [[ZETA (fusion reactor)|ZETA]] and [[Sceptre (fusion reactor)|Sceptre]] devices.

Spitzer had planned an aggressive development project of four machines, A, B, C, and D. A and B were small research devices, C would be the prototype of a power-producing machine, and D would be the prototype of a commercial device. A worked without issue, but even by the time B was being used it was clear the stellarator was also suffering from instabilities and plasma leakage. Progress on C slowed as attempts were made to correct for these problems.

By the mid-1950s it was clear that the simple theoretical tools being used to calculate the performance of all fusion machines were simply not predicting their actual behavior. Machines invariably leaked their plasma from their confinement area at rates far higher than predicted. In 1954, [[Edward Teller]] held a gathering of fusion researchers at the Princeton Gun Club, near the Project Matterhorn (now known as [[Project Sherwood]]) grounds. Teller started by pointing out the problems that everyone was having, and suggested that any system where the plasma was confined within concave fields was doomed to fail. Attendees remember him saying something to the effect that the fields were like rubber bands, and they would attempt to snap back to a straight configuration whenever the power was increased, ejecting the plasma. He went on to say that it appeared the only way to confine the plasma in a stable configuration would be to use convex fields, a ""cusp"" configuration.<ref>{{cite book|author=Nathaniel Fisch|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=9i9bgMLVjWsC|page=118}}|title=Edward Teller Centennial Symposium|page=118|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref>

When the meeting concluded, most of the researchers quickly turned out papers saying why Teller's concerns did not apply to their particular device. The pinch machines did not use magnetic fields in this way at all, while the mirror and stellarator seemed to have various ways out. This was soon followed by a paper by [[Martin David Kruskal]] and [[Martin Schwarzschild]] discussing pinch machines, however, which demonstrated instabilities in those devices were inherent to the design.

The largest ""classic"" pinch device was the [[ZETA (fusion reactor)|ZETA]], including all of these suggested upgrades, starting operations in the UK in 1957. In early 1958, [[John Cockcroft]] announced that fusion had been achieved in the ZETA, an announcement that made headlines around the world. When physicists in the US expressed concerns about the claims they were initially dismissed. US experiments soon demonstrated the same neutrons, although temperature measurements suggested these could not be from fusion reactions. The neutrons seen in the UK were later demonstrated to be from different versions of the same instability processes that plagued earlier machines. Cockcroft was forced to retract the fusion claims, and the entire field was tainted for years. ZETA ended its experiments in 1968.

The first controlled fusion experiment was accomplished using Scylla I at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in 1958. This was a pinch machine, with a cylinder full of deuterium. Electric current shot down the sides of the cylinder. The current made magnetic fields that compressed the plasma to 15 million degrees Celsius, squeezed the gas, fused it and produced neutrons.<ref name=""Seife, Charles 2008""/><ref name=""Phillips, James 2013""/>

In 1950–1951 [[Igor Tamm|I.E. Tamm]] and [[Andrei Sakharov|A.D. Sakharov]] in the [[Soviet Union]], first discussed a [[tokamak]]-like approach. Experimental research on those designs began in 1956 at the [[Kurchatov Institute]] in [[Moscow]] by a group of Soviet scientists led by [[Lev Artsimovich]]. The tokamak essentially combined a low-power pinch device with a low-power simple stellarator. The key was to combine the fields in such a way that the particles orbited within the reactor a particular number of times, today known as the ""[[Safety factor (plasma physics)|safety factor]]"". The combination of these fields dramatically improved confinement times and densities, resulting in huge improvements over existing devices.

=== 1960s ===
A key plasma physics text was published by [[Lyman Spitzer]] at Princeton in 1963.<ref>Lyman J Spitzer, ""The Physics of Fully Ionized Gases"" 1963</ref> Spitzer took the ideal gas laws and adapted them to an ionized plasma, developing many of the fundamental equations used to model a plasma.

Laser fusion was suggested in 1962 by scientists at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], shortly after the invention of the laser itself in 1960. At the time, Lasers were low power machines, but low-level research began as early as 1965. Laser fusion, formally known as [[inertial confinement fusion]], involves [[Implosion (mechanical process)|imploding]] a target by using [[laser]] beams. There are two ways to do this: indirect drive and direct drive. In direct drive, the laser blasts a pellet of fuel. In indirect drive, the lasers blast a structure around the fuel. This makes [[x-rays]] that squeeze the fuel. Both methods compress the fuel so that fusion can take place.

At the [[1964 World's Fair]], the public was given its first demonstration of nuclear fusion.<ref>[http://www.nywf64.com/genele08.shtml]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030210437/http://www.nywf64.com/genele08.shtml |date=October 30, 2014 }}</ref> The device was a θ-pinch from General Electric. This was similar to the Scylla machine developed earlier at Los Alamos.

The [[magnetic mirror]] was first published in 1967 by [[Richard F. Post]] and many others at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.<ref name=""Mirror Systems 1969""/> The mirror consisted of two large magnets arranged so they had strong fields within them, and a weaker, but connected, field between them. Plasma introduced in the area between the two magnets would ""bounce back"" from the stronger fields in the middle.

The [[Andrei Sakharov|A.D. Sakharov]] group constructed the first tokamaks, the most successful being the [[T-3 (tokamak)|T-3]] and its larger version [[T-4 (tokamak)|T-4]]. T-4 was tested in 1968 in [[Novosibirsk]], producing the world's first quasistationary fusion reaction.<ref>""Nuclear Power: A Very Short Introduction"" 2011, page 90, Maxwell Irvine</ref> When this were first announced, the international community was highly skeptical. A British team was invited to see T-3, however, and after measuring it in depth they released their results that confirmed the Soviet claims. A burst of activity followed as many planned devices were abandoned and new tokamaks were introduced in their place — the C model stellarator, then under construction after many redesigns, was quickly converted to the Symmetrical Tokamak.

In his work with vacuum tubes, [[Philo Farnsworth]] observed that electric charge would accumulate in regions of the tube. Today, this effect is known as the [[Multipactor effect]].<ref>Cartlidge, Edwin. The Secret World of Amateur Fusion. Physics World, March 2007: IOP Publishing Ltd, pp. 10-11. {{ISSN|0953-8585}}.</ref> Farnsworth reasoned that if ions were concentrated high enough they could collide and fuse. In 1962, he filed a patent on a design using a positive inner cage to concentrate plasma, in order to achieve nuclear fusion.<ref>US Patent 3,258,402 June 28, 1966</ref> During this time, [[Robert L. Hirsch]] joined the Farnsworth Television labs and began work on what became the fusor. Hirsch patented the design in 1966<ref>US Patent 3,386,883 June 4, 1968</ref> and published the design in 1967.<ref>Robert L. Hirsch, ""Inertial-Electrostatic Confinement of Ionized Fusion Gases"", Journal of Applied Physics, v. 38, no. 7, October 1967</ref>

In 1972, John Nuckolls outlined the idea of ignition.<ref name=""Nuckolls, John 1972""/> This is a fusion chain reaction. Hot helium made during fusion reheats the fuel and starts more reactions. John argued that ignition would require lasers of about 1&nbsp;kJ. This turned out to be wrong. Nuckolls's paper started a major development effort. Several laser systems were built at LLNL. These included the [[Argus laser|argus]], the [[Cyclops laser|Cyclops]], the [[Janus laser|Janus]], the [[Long path laser|long path]], the [[Shiva laser]] and the [[Nova (laser)|Nova]] in 1984. This prompted the UK to build the [[Central Laser Facility]] in 1976.<ref>M.H. Key 1985 Nucl. Fusion 25 1351, {{DOI|10.1088/0029-5515/25/9/063}}</ref>

During this time, great strides in understanding the tokamak system were made. A number of improvements to the design are now part of the ""advanced tokamak"" concept, which includes non-circular plasma, internal diverters and limiters, often superconducting magnets, and operate in the so-called ""H-mode"" island of increased stability. Two other designs have also become fairly well studied; the compact tokamak is wired with the magnets on the inside of the vacuum chamber, while the [[spherical tokamak]] reduces its cross section as much as possible.

In 1974 a study of the ZETA results demonstrated an interesting side-effect; after an experimental run ended, the plasma would enter a short period of stability. This led to the [[reversed field pinch]] concept, which has seen some level of development since. On May 1, 1974, the KMS fusion company (founded by [[Kip Siegel]]) achieves the world's first laser induced fusion in a deuterium-tritium pellet.<ref>""A Piece of the sun"" by Dan Clery, June 2014</ref>

In the mid-1970s, [[Project PACER]], carried out at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) explored the possibility of a fusion power system that would involve exploding small [[H-bomb|hydrogen bomb]]s (fusion bombs) inside an underground cavity.<ref>Long 1976, p. 25.</ref> As an energy source, the system is the only fusion power system that could be demonstrated to work using existing technology. It would also require a large, continuous supply of nuclear bombs, however, making the economics of such a system rather questionable.

In 1976, the two beam [[Argus laser]] becomes operational at livermore{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}. In 1977, The 20 beam [[Shiva laser]] at Livermore is completed, capable of delivering 10.2 kilojoules of infrared energy on target. At a price of $25 million and a size approaching that of a football field, Shiva is the first of the megalasers {{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}. That same year, the [[Joint European Torus|JET]] project is approved by the [[European Commission]] and a site is selected.

As a result of advocacy, the cold war, and the [[1970s energy crisis]] a massive [[magnetic mirror]] program was funded by the US federal government in the late 1970s and early 1980s. This program resulted in a series of large magnetic mirror devices including: 2X,<ref>Principals of plasma physics, Nicholas Krall, 1973, Page 273</ref> Baseball I, Baseball II, the [[Tandem Mirror Experiment]], the Tandem mirror experiment upgrade, the [[Mirror Fusion Test Facility]] and the MFTF-B. These machines were built and tested at Livermore from the late 1960s to the mid 1980s.<ref>""Summary of results from the tandem mirror experiment, TMX group, February 26, 1981</ref><ref>""TMX Major Project proposal"" Fred Coensgen, January 12, 1977</ref> A number of institutions collaborated on these machines, conducting experiments. These included the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] and the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. The last machine, the [[Mirror Fusion Test Facility]] cost 372 million dollars and was, at that time, the most expensive project in Livermore history.<ref>Booth, William. ""Fusion's $372-Million Mothball."" Science [New York City] 9 Oct. 1987, Volume 238 ed.: 152-55. Print.</ref> It opened on February 21, 1986 and was promptly shut down. The reason given was to balance the United States federal budget. This program was supported from within the Carter and early Reagan administrations by [[Edwin E. Kintner]], a US Navy captain, under [[Alvin Trivelpiece]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/21/science/21kintner.html |first=Niko |last=Koppel |title=Edwin E.

In Laser fusion progressed: in 1983, the [[NOVETTE laser]] was completed. The following December 1984, the ten beam [[NOVA laser]] was finished. Five years later, NOVA would produce a maximum of 120 kilojoules of infrared light, during a nanosecond pulse {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. Meanwhile, efforts focused on either fast delivery or beam smoothness. Both tried to deliver the energy uniformly to implode the target. One early problem was that the light in the [[infrared]] wavelength, lost lots of energy before hitting the fuel. Breakthroughs were made at the [[Laboratory for Laser Energetics]] at the [[University of Rochester]]. Rochester scientists used frequency-tripling crystals to transform the infrared laser beams into ultraviolet beams. In 1985, [[Donna Strickland]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/science/magnet-talent-more-stories/dr-donna-strickland |title=Dr. Donna Strickland &#124; Science |publisher=Uwaterloo.ca |accessdate=2014-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111204111/https://uwaterloo.ca/science/magnet-talent-more-stories/dr-donna-strickland |archivedate=2014-01-11 |df= }}</ref> and [[Gérard Mourou]] invented a method to amplify lasers pulses by ""chirping"". This method changes a single wavelength into a full spectrum. The system then amplifies the laser at each wavelength and then reconstitutes the beam into one color. Chirp pulsed amplification became instrumental in building the National Ignition Facility and the Omega EP system. Most research into ICF was towards weapons research, because the implosion is relevant to nuclear weapons.

During this time [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] constructed a series of laser facilities.<ref name = ""NRDC"">{{cite web|title=When peer review fails : The Roots of the National Ignition Facility (NIF) Debacle|date=2000|publisher=National Resources Defense Council|author1=Dr. Matthew McKinzie|author2=Christopher E.

In 1987, Akira Hasegawa <ref>Hasegawa, A., Comments on Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion, 1987, vol. 1, p. 147.</ref> noticed that in a dipolar magnetic field, fluctuations tended to compress the plasma without energy loss. This effect was noticed in data taken by [[Voyager 2]], when it encountered Uranus. This observation would become the basis for a fusion approach known as the [[Levitated dipole]].

In Tokamaks, the [[Tore Supra]] was under construction over the middle of the eighties (1983 to 1988). This was a [[Tokamak]] built in [[Cadarache]], France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-drfc.cea.fr/gb/cea/ts/ts.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 3, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115112229/http://www-drfc.cea.fr/gb/cea/ts/ts.htm |archivedate=November 15, 2012 }}</ref> In 1983, the [[Joint European Torus|JET]] was completed and first plasmas achieved.

It was the first industrial fusion reactor to use [[superconducting]] magnets to control the plasma. These were Helium cooled.

In 1984, Martin Peng of ORNL proposed<ref>Y-K Martin Peng, ""Spherical Torus, Compact Fusion at Low Yield""., ORNL/FEDC-87/7 (December 1984)</ref> an alternate arrangement of the magnet coils that would greatly reduce the aspect ratio while avoiding the erosion issues of the compact tokamak: a [[Spherical tokamak]]. Instead of wiring each magnet coil separately, he proposed using a single large conductor in the center, and wiring the magnets as half-rings off of this conductor. What was once a series of individual rings passing through the hole in the center of the reactor was reduced to a single post, allowing for aspect ratios as low as 1.2.<ref>Sykes 1997, pg. B247</ref><ref name=""Braams and Scott, pg. 225"">Braams and Scott, pg. 225</ref> The ST concept appeared to represent an enormous advance in tokamak design. However, it was being proposed during a period when US fusion research budgets were being dramatically scaled back. ORNL was provided with funds to develop a suitable central column built out of a high-strength copper alloy called ""Glidcop"". However, they were unable to secure funding to build a demonstration machine, ""STX"". Failing to build an ST at ORNL, Peng began a worldwide effort to interest other teams in the ST concept and get a test machine built. One way to do this quickly would be to convert a spheromak machine to the [[Spherical tokamak]] layout.<ref name=""Braams and Scott, pg. 225""/> Peng's advocacy also caught the interest of [[Derek Robinson (physicist)|Derek Robinson]], of the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] fusion center at [[Culham]]. Robinson was able to gather together a team and secure funding on the order of 100,000 pounds to build an experimental machine, the [[Small Tight Aspect Ratio Tokamak]], or START. Several parts of the machine were recycled from earlier projects, while others were loaned from other labs, including a 40 keV neutral beam injector from ORNL. Construction of [[Small Tight Aspect Ratio Tokamak|START]] began in 1990, it was assembled rapidly and started operation in January 1991.<ref>Sykes 2008, pg. 11</ref>

In the late nineties, a team at [[Columbia University]] and [[MIT]] developed the [[Levitated dipole]] a fusion device which consisted of a superconducting electromagnet, floating in a saucer shaped vacuum chamber. Plasma swirled around this donut and fused along the center axis.

""Fast ignition"" was developed in the late nineties, and was part of a push by the [[Laboratory for Laser Energetics]] for building the Omega EP system. This system was finished in 2008. Fast ignition showed such dramatic power savings that ICF appears to be a useful technique for energy production. There are even proposals to build an experimental facility dedicated to the fast ignition approach, known as [[HiPER]].

In April 2005, a team from [[UCLA]] announced<ref>{{cite web|url=https://discover.com/issues/jan-06/features/physics/ |title=The Year in Science: Physics |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2006-10-21 |accessdate=2013-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20061021025402/https://discover.com/issues/jan-06/features/physics/ |archivedate=October 21, 2006 }}</ref> it had devised a way of producing fusion using a machine that ""fits on a lab bench"", using [[lithium tantalate]] to generate enough voltage to smash deuterium atoms together. The process, however, does not generate net power (see [[Pyroelectric fusion]]). Such a device would be useful in the same sort of roles as the fusor. In 2006, China's [[EAST]] test reactor is completed. This was the first tokamak to use superconducting magnets to generate both the toroidal and poloidal fields.

In the early 2000s, Researchers at [[LANL]] reasoned that a plasma oscillating could be at local thermodynamic equilibrium.

In 2010, NIF researchers were conducting a series of ""tuning"" shots to determine the optimal target design and laser parameters for high-energy ignition experiments with fusion fuel in the following months.<ref>{{cite web |last=Seaver |first=Lynda L. |title=World's largest laser sets records for neutron yield and laser energy |publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory |date=2010-10-01 |url=https://www.llnl.gov/news/newsreleases/2010/Nov/NR-10-11-02.html |accessdate=2013-06-22}}</ref> Two firing tests were performed on October 31, 2010 and November 2, 2010.

Inertial (laser) confinement is being developed at the [[United States]] [[National Ignition Facility]] (NIF) based at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] in [[California]], the [[France|French]] [[Laser Mégajoule]], and the planned [[European Union]] [[HiPER|High Power laser Energy Research]] (HiPER) facility.

A 2012 paper demonstrated that a dense plasma focus had achieved temperatures of 1.8 billion degrees Celsius, sufficient for [[Proton-boron fusion|boron fusion]], and that fusion reactions were occurring primarily within the contained plasmoid, a necessary condition for net power.<ref name=""PB11"">[http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/0710/0710.3149.pdf ""ADVANCES TOWARDS PB11 FUSION WITH THE DENSE PLASMA FOCUS""], Eric Lerner, Lawrenceville Plasma Physics, 2008</ref> The focus consists of two coaxial cylindrical electrodes made from copper or beryllium and housed in a vacuum chamber containing a low-pressure fusible gas. An electrical pulse is applied across the electrodes, heating the gas into a plasma. The current forms into a minuscule vortex along the axis of the machine, which then kinks into a cage of current with an associated magnetic field. The cage of current and magnetic-field-entrapped plasma is called a [[plasmoid]]. The acceleration of the electrons about the magnetic field lines heats the nuclei within the plasmoid to fusion temperatures.

== Fuels ==
By firing particle beams at targets, many fusion reactions have been tested, while the fuels considered for power have all been light elements like the isotopes of hydrogen—[[deuterium]] and [[tritium]].<ref name=""osti.gov""/> Other reactions like the deuterium and Helium<sup>3</sup> reaction or the Helium<sup>3</sup> and Helium<sup>3</sup> reactions, would require a supply of Helium<sup>3</sup>. This can either come from other nuclear reactions or from extraterrestrial sources. Finally, researchers hope to do the p-{{SimpleNuclide|Boron|11}} reaction, because it does not directly produce neutrons, though side reactions can.<ref name=""AtzeniMeyer-ter-Vehn2004"">{{cite book|first1=Stefano |last=Atzeni|first2=Jürgen Meyer-ter-Vehn|title=The Physics of Inertial Fusion: BeamPlasma Interaction, Hydrodynamics, Hot Dense Matter|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=BJcy_p5pUBsC}}|date=3 June 2004|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-152405-9|pages=12–13}}</ref>

=== Deuterium, tritium ===
[[File:Deuterium-tritium fusion.svg|thumb|Diagram of the D-T reaction]]
The easiest nuclear reaction, at the lowest energy, is:

:{{nuclide|Deuterium|link=yes}} + {{nuclide|Tritium|link=yes}} → {{nuclide|Helium|link=yes}} + {{SubatomicParticle|10neutron|link=yes}}

This reaction is common in research, industrial and military applications, usually as a convenient source of neutrons. [[Deuterium]] is a naturally occurring [[isotope]] of hydrogen and is commonly available. The large mass ratio of the hydrogen isotopes makes their separation easy compared to the difficult [[uranium enrichment]] process. [[Tritium]] is a natural isotope of hydrogen, but because it has a short [[half-life]] of 12.32 years, it is hard to find, store, produce, and is expensive. Consequently, the deuterium-tritium fuel cycle requires the [[breeder reactor|breeding]] of [[tritium]] from [[lithium]] using one of the following reactions:

:{{SubatomicParticle|10neutron}} + {{nuclide|Lithium|6}} → {{nuclide|Tritium}} + {{nuclide|Helium}}
:{{SubatomicParticle|10neutron}} + {{nuclide|Lithium|7}} → {{nuclide|Tritium}} + {{nuclide|Helium}} + {{SubatomicParticle|10neutron}}

The reactant neutron is supplied by the D-T fusion reaction shown above, and the one that has the greatest yield of energy. The reaction with <sup>6</sup>Li is [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]], providing a small energy gain for the reactor. The reaction with <sup>7</sup>Li is [[endothermic reaction|endothermic]] but does not consume the neutron. At least some <sup>7</sup>Li reactions are required to replace the neutrons lost to absorption by other elements. Most reactor designs use the naturally occurring mix of lithium isotopes.

Several drawbacks are commonly attributed to D-T fusion power:
# It produces substantial amounts of neutrons that result in the [[neutron activation]] of the reactor materials.<ref name=""Thinkquest"">{{cite web| publisher= | url=http://library.thinkquest.org/17940/texts/fusion_dt/fusion_dt.html | title= Thinkquest: D-T reaction | accessdate=12 June 2010 | postscript= <!--None-->}}</ref>
# Only about 20% of the fusion energy yield appears in the form of charged particles with the remainder carried off by neutrons, which limits the extent to which direct energy conversion techniques might be applied.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Iiyoshi|first=A|author2=H. Momota |author3=O Motojima |display-authors=etal |title=Innovative Energy Production in Fusion Reactors|journal=National Institute for Fusion Science NIFS|date=October 1993|pages=2–3|url=http://www.nifs.ac.jp/report/nifs250.html|accessdate=14 February 2012}}</ref>
# It requires the handling of the radioisotope tritium. Similar to hydrogen, tritium is difficult to contain and may leak from reactors in some quantity. Some estimates suggest that this would represent a fairly large environmental release of radioactivity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf66.html|title=Nuclear Fusion Power, Assessing fusion power|publisher=World-nuclear.org|accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref>

The [[neutron flux]] expected in a commercial D-T fusion reactor is about 100 times that of current fission power reactors, posing problems for [[plasma facing material|material design]]. After a series of D-T tests at [[Joint European Torus|JET]], the vacuum vessel was sufficiently radioactive that remote handling was required for the year following the tests.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rolfe|first=A. C.|title=Remote Handling JET Experience|journal=Nuclear Energy|date=1999|volume=38|issue=5|page=6|url=http://www.iop.org/Jet/fulltext/JETP99028.pdf|accessdate=10 April 2012|issn=0140-4067}}</ref>

In a production setting, the neutrons would be used to react with [[lithium]] in the context of a breeder blanket comprising lithium ceramic pebbles or liquid lithium, in order to create more tritium. This also deposits the energy of the neutrons in the lithium, which would then be transferred to drive electrical production. The lithium neutron absorption reaction protects the outer portions of the reactor from the neutron flux. Newer designs, the advanced tokamak in particular, also use lithium inside the reactor core as a key element of the design. The plasma interacts directly with the lithium, preventing a problem known as ""recycling"". The advantage of this design was demonstrated in the [[Lithium Tokamak Experiment]].

[[File:Deuterium Deuterium Fusion Cross Section.png|thumbnail|Deuterium fusion cross section (in square meters) at different ion collision energies.]]
This is the second easiest fusion reaction, fusing two deuterium nuclei. The reaction has two branches that occur with nearly equal probability:
:{|
|D + D || → T|| + <sup>1</sup>H
|-
|D + D || → <sup>3</sup>He || + n
|}
This reaction is also common in research. The optimum energy to initiate this reaction is 15&nbsp;keV, only slightly higher than the optimum for the D-T reaction. The first branch does not produce neutrons, but it does produce tritium, so that a D-D reactor will not be completely tritium-free, even though it does not require an input of tritium or lithium. Unless the tritons can be quickly removed, most of the tritium produced would be burned before leaving the reactor, which would reduce the handling of tritium, but would produce more neutrons, some of which are very energetic. The neutron from the second branch has an energy of only {{convert|2.45|MeV|abbr=on}}, whereas the neutron from the D-T reaction has an energy of {{convert|14.1|MeV|abbr=on}}, resulting in a wider range of isotope production and material damage. When the tritons are removed quickly while allowing the <sup>3</sup>He to react, the fuel cycle is called ""tritium suppressed fusion""<ref>M. Sawan, S. Zinkle, and J. Sheffield, ''Fusion Eng Des'' 61-2, 561 (2002).</ref> The removed tritium decays to <sup>3</sup>He with a 12.5 year half life. By recycling the <sup>3</sup>He produced from the decay of tritium back into the fusion reactor, the fusion reactor does not require materials resistant to fast {{convert|14.1|MeV|abbr=on}} neutrons.

Assuming complete tritium burn-up, the reduction in the fraction of fusion energy carried by neutrons would be only about 18%, so that the primary advantage of the D-D fuel cycle is that tritium breeding would not be required. Other advantages are independence from scarce{{Dubious|date=June 2015}} lithium resources and a somewhat softer neutron spectrum. The disadvantage of D-D compared to D-T is that the energy confinement time (at a given pressure) must be 30 times longer and the power produced (at a given pressure and volume) would be 68 times less{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}.

Assuming complete removal of tritium and recycling of <sup>3</sup>He, only 6% of the fusion energy is carried by neutrons. The tritium-suppressed D-D fusion requires an energy confinement that is 10 times longer compared to D-T and a plasma temperature that is twice as high.<ref>J. Kesner, D. Garnier, A. Hansen, M. Mauel, and L. Bromberg, ''Nucl Fusion'' 2004; 44, 193</ref>

=== Deuterium, helium 3 ===
A second-generation approach to controlled fusion power involves combining [[helium-3]] (<sup>3</sup>He) and [[deuterium]] (<sup>2</sup>H):

:{|
|D + <sup>3</sup>He || → <sup>4</sup>He || + <sup>1</sup>H
|}

This reaction produces a helium-4 nucleus (<sup>4</sup>He) and a high-energy proton. As with the p-<sup>11</sup>B [[aneutronic fusion]] fuel cycle, most of the reaction energy is released as charged particles, reducing [[neutron activation|activation]] of the reactor housing and potentially allowing more efficient energy harvesting (via any of several speculative technologies).{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} In practice, D-D side reactions produce a significant number of neutrons, resulting in p-<sup>11</sup>B being the preferred cycle for aneutronic fusion.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

=== Proton, boron 11 ===
If [[aneutronic fusion]] is the goal, then the most promising candidate may be the Hydrogen-1 (proton)/[[boron]] reaction, which releases alpha (helium) particles, but does not rely on [[neutron scattering]] for energy transfer.

:<sup>1</sup>H + <sup>11</sup>B → 3&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>He

Under reasonable assumptions, side reactions will result in about 0.1% of the fusion power being carried by neutrons.<ref>Heindler and Kernbichler, ''Proc. 5th Intl. Conf. on Emerging Nuclear Energy Systems'', 1989, pp. 177–82. See also [[Aneutronic fusion#Residual radiation from a p–11B reactor|Residual radiation from a p–11B reactor]]</ref> At 123 keV, the optimum temperature for this reaction is nearly ten times higher than that for the pure hydrogen reactions, the energy confinement must be 500 times better than that required for the D-T reaction, and the [[power density]] will be 2500 times lower than for D-T.

Because the confinement properties of conventional approaches to fusion such as the tokamak and laser pellet fusion are marginal, most proposals for aneutronic fusion are based on radically different confinement concepts, such as the [[Polywell]] and the [[Dense Plasma Focus]]. Results have been extremely promising:

== Material selection ==
{{Main article|International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility}}

=== Considerations ===
Any power station using hot plasma, is going to have plasma facing walls. In even the simplest plasma approaches, the material will get blasted with matter and energy. This leads to a minimum list of considerations, including dealing with:

* A heating and cooling cycle, up to a 10&nbsp;MW/m² thermal load.
* [[Neutron radiation]], which over time leads to [[neutron activation]] and [[embrittlement]].
* High energy ions leaving at tens to hundreds of [[electronvolt]]s.
* [[Alpha particle]]s leaving at millions of [[electronvolt]]s.
* Electrons leaving at high energy.
* Light radiation (IR, visible, UV, X-ray).

Depending on the approach, these effects may be higher or lower than typical [[Nuclear fission|fission]] reactors like the [[pressurized water reactor]] (PWR).<ref name=""Shin Kajita 2014"">""Thermal response of nanostructured tungsten""Shin Kajita, et al., January 2014, Nucl. Fusion 54 (2014) 033005 (10pp)</ref> One estimate put the [[neutron radiation|radiation]] at 100 times the (PWR){{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}.

M.|last8 = Mummery}}</ref> Depending on the approach, however, there may be other considerations such as [[electrical conductivity]], [[Vacuum permeability|magnetic permeability]] and mechanical strength. There is also a need for materials whose primary components and impurities do not result in long-lived radioactive wastes.

=== Durability ===
For long term use, each atom in the wall is expected to be hit by a neutron and displaced about a hundred times before the material is replaced. High-energy neutrons will produce hydrogen and helium by way of various nuclear reactions that tends to form bubbles at grain boundaries and result in swelling, blistering or embrittlement.<ref name=""Shin Kajita 2014""/>

=== Selection ===
One can choose either a low-[[Atomic number|Z]] material, such as [[graphite]] or [[beryllium]], or a high-[[Atomic number|Z]] material, usually [[tungsten]] with [[molybdenum]] as a second choice. Use of liquid metals (lithium, gallium, tin) has also been proposed, e.g., by injection of 1–5&nbsp;mm thick streams flowing at 10&nbsp;m/s on solid substrates{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}.

If graphite is used, the gross erosion rates due to physical and chemical [[sputtering]] would be many meters per year, so one must rely on redeposition of the sputtered material. The location of the redeposition will not exactly coincide with the location of the sputtering, so one is still left with erosion rates that may be prohibitive. An even larger problem is the tritium co-deposited with the redeposited graphite. The tritium inventory in graphite layers and dust in a reactor could quickly build up to many kilograms, representing a waste of resources and a serious radiological hazard in case of an accident. The consensus of the fusion community seems to be that graphite, although a very attractive material for fusion experiments, cannot be the primary [[plasma-facing material]] (PFM) in a commercial reactor.

The sputtering rate of tungsten by the plasma fuel ions is orders of magnitude smaller than that of carbon, and tritium is much less incorporated into redeposited tungsten, making this a more attractive choice. On the other hand, tungsten impurities in a plasma are much more damaging than carbon impurities, and self-sputtering of tungsten can be high, so it will be necessary to ensure that the plasma in contact with the tungsten is not too hot (a few tens of eV rather than hundreds of eV). Tungsten also has disadvantages in terms of eddy currents and melting in off-normal events, as well as some radiological issues.

== Safety and the environment ==

=== Accident potential ===
Nuclear fusion is unlike nuclear fission: fusion requires extremely precise and controlled temperature, pressure and magnetic field parameters for any net energy to be produced. If a reactor suffers damage or loses even a small degree of required control, fusion reactions and heat generation would rapidly cease.<ref name=afraid>{{cite web |url= http://www.iter.org/newsline/107/1489 |title= Who is afraid of ITER? |first= Krista|last=Dulon |work=iter.org |date=2012 |accessdate=18 August 2012}}</ref> Additionally, fusion reactors contain relatively small amounts of fuel, enough to ""burn"" for minutes, or in some cases, microseconds. Unless they are actively refueled, the reactions will quickly end. Therefore, fusion reactors are considered immune from catastrophic meltdown.<ref name=""McCrackenStott2012"">{{cite book|last1=McCracken|first1=Garry |last2=Stott|first2=Peter |title=Fusion: The Energy of the Universe|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=e6jEZfO2gO4C|page=198}}|accessdate=18 August 2012|date=8 June 2012|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-384656-3|pages=198–199}}</ref>

Runaway reactions cannot occur in a fusion reactor. The [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] is burnt at optimal conditions, and any significant change will quench the reactions. The reaction process is so delicate that this level of safety is inherent. Although the plasma in a fusion power station is expected to have a volume of {{Convert|1000|m3}} or more, the plasma density is low and the total amount of fusion fuel in the vessel typically only a few grams.<ref name=""McCrackenStott2012"" /> If the fuel supply is closed, the reaction stops within seconds. In comparison, a fission reactor is typically loaded with enough fuel for several months or years, and no additional fuel is necessary to continue the reaction. It is this large amount of fuel that gives rise to the possibility of a meltdown; nothing analogous exists in a fusion reactor.<ref name=""n"">{{cite book|last=Angelo|first=Joseph A. |title=Nuclear Technology|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=ITfaP-xY3LsC|page=474}}|accessdate=18 August 2012|date=30 November 2004|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-57356-336-9|page=474}}</ref>

In the magnetic approach, strong fields are developed in coils that are held in place mechanically by the reactor structure. Failure of this structure could release this tension and allow the magnet to ""explode"" outward. The severity of this event would be similar to any other industrial accident or an [[MRI]] machine quench/explosion, and could be effectively stopped with a [[containment building]] similar to those used in existing (fission) nuclear generators. The laser-driven inertial approach is generally lower-stress because of the increased size of the reaction chamber. Although failure of the reaction chamber is possible, simply stopping fuel delivery would prevent any sort of catastrophic failure.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Most reactor designs rely on liquid hydrogen as both a coolant and a method for converting stray neutrons from the reaction into [[tritium]], which is fed back into the reactor as fuel. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and in the case of a fire it is possible that the hydrogen stored on-site could be burned up and escape. In this case, the tritium contents of the hydrogen would be released into the atmosphere, posing a radiation risk. Calculations suggest that at about {{convert|1|kg}}, the total amount of tritium and other radioactive gases in a typical power station would be so small that they would have diluted to legally acceptable limits by the time they blew as far as the station's [[perimeter fence]].<ref name=""WorldEnergyCouncil""/>

The likelihood of small industrial accidents, including the local release of radioactivity and injury to staff, cannot be estimated yet. These would include accidental releases of lithium or tritium or mishandling of decommissioned radioactive components of the reactor itself.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

===Magnet quench===
A quench is an abnormal termination of magnet operation that occurs when part of the superconducting coil enters the normal ([[resistive]]) state. This can occur because the field inside the magnet is too large, the rate of change of field is too large (causing [[eddy current]]s and resultant [[Joule heating|heating]] in the copper support matrix), or a combination of the two.

More rarely a defect in the magnet can cause a quench. When this happens, that particular spot is subject to rapid [[Joule heating]] from the enormous current, which raises the [[temperature]] of the surrounding regions. This pushes those regions into the normal state as well, which leads to more heating in a chain reaction. The entire magnet rapidly becomes normal (this can take several seconds, depending on the size of the superconducting coil). This is accompanied by a loud bang as the energy in the magnetic field is converted to heat, and rapid boil-off of the [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] fluid. The abrupt decrease of current can result in kilovolt inductive voltage spikes and arcing. Permanent damage to the magnet is rare, but components can be damaged by localized heating, high voltages, or large mechanical forces.

In practice, magnets usually have safety devices to stop or limit the current when the beginning of a quench is detected. If a large magnet undergoes a quench, the inert vapor formed by the evaporating cryogenic fluid can present a significant [[asphyxiation]] hazard to operators by displacing breathable air.

A large section of the superconducting magnets in [[CERN]]'s [[Large Hadron Collider]] unexpectedly quenched during start-up operations in 2008, necessitating the replacement of a number of magnets.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://edms.cern.ch/file/973073/1/Report_on_080919_incident_at_LHC__2_.pdf |format=PDF| title = Interim Summary Report on the Analysis of the 19 September 2008 Incident at the LHC |publisher = CERN}}</ref> In order to mitigate against potentially destructive quenches, the superconducting magnets that form the LHC are equipped with fast-ramping heaters which are activated once a quench event is detected by the complex quench protection system. As the dipole bending magnets are connected in series, each power circuit includes 154 individual magnets, and should a quench event occur, the entire combined stored energy of these magnets must be dumped at once. This energy is transferred into dumps that are massive blocks of metal which heat up to several hundreds of degrees Celsius—because of resistive heating—in a matter of seconds. Although undesirable, a magnet quench is a ""fairly routine event"" during the operation of a particle accelerator.<ref>{{cite web|last=Peterson|first=Tom|title=Explain it in 60 seconds: Magnet Quench|url=http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/november-2008/explain-it-in-60-seconds-magnet-quench|work=Symmetry Magazine|publisher=[[Fermilab]]/[[SLAC]]|accessdate=15 February 2013}}</ref>

=== Effluents  ===
The natural product of the fusion reaction is a small amount of [[helium]], which is completely harmless to life. Of more concern is [[tritium]], which, like other isotopes of hydrogen, is difficult to retain completely. During normal operation, some amount of tritium will be continually released.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Although tritium is volatile and biologically active, the health risk posed by a release is much lower than that of most radioactive contaminants, because of tritium's short half-life (12.32 years) and very low decay energy (~14.95 keV), and because it does not [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] (instead being cycled out of the body as water, with a [[biological half-life]] of 7 to 14 days).<ref name=""nuclearsafety-petrangeli"">{{cite book|first=Gianni |last=Petrangeli|title=Nuclear Safety|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=5X2Hxad9BoQC|page=430}}|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=978-0-7506-6723-4|page=430}}</ref> Current ITER designs are investigating total containment facilities for any tritium.

=== Waste management ===
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2017}}
The large flux of high-energy neutrons in a reactor will make the structural materials radioactive. The radioactive inventory at shut-down may be comparable to that of a fission reactor, but there are important differences.

The half-life of the [[radioisotopes]] produced by fusion tends to be less than those from fission, so that the inventory decreases more rapidly. Unlike fission reactors, whose waste remains radioactive for thousands of years, most of the radioactive material in a fusion reactor would be the reactor core itself, which would be dangerous for about 50 years, and low-level waste for another 100.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Although this waste will be considerably more radioactive during those 50 years than fission waste, the very short half-life makes the process very attractive, as the waste management is fairly straightforward. By 500 years the material would have the same radiotoxicity as [[coal ash]].<ref name=""WorldEnergyCouncil"">{{cite web

}}</ref>

Additionally, the choice of materials used in a fusion reactor is less constrained than in a fission design, where many materials are required for their specific [[neutron cross-section]]s. This allows a fusion reactor to be designed using materials that are selected specifically to be ""low activation"", materials that do not easily become radioactive. [[Vanadium]], for example, would become much less radioactive than [[stainless steel]]. [[Carbon fiber]] materials are also low-activation, as well as being strong and light, and are a promising area of study for laser-inertial reactors where a magnetic field is not required.

In general terms, fusion reactors would create far less radioactive material than a fission reactor, the material it would create is less damaging biologically, and the radioactivity ""burns off"" within a time period that is well within existing engineering capabilities for safe long-term waste storage.

=== Nuclear proliferation ===
{{main article|Nuclear proliferation}}
Although fusion power uses nuclear technology, the overlap with nuclear weapons would be limited. A huge amount of [[tritium]] could be produced by a fusion power station; tritium is used in the trigger of [[hydrogen bomb]]s and in a modern [[boosted fission weapon]], but it can also be produced by nuclear fission. The energetic neutrons from a fusion reactor could be used to breed weapons-grade [[plutonium]] or [[uranium]] for an atomic bomb (for example by transmutation of U<sup>238</sup> to Pu<sup>239</sup>, or Th<sup>232</sup> to U<sup>233</sup>).

A study conducted 2011 assessed the risk of three scenarios:<ref name=""ProliferationRisk_Goldston"" />

* ''Use in small-scale fusion station'': As a result of much higher power consumption, heat dissipation and a more recognizable design compared to enrichment [[gas centrifuge]]s this choice would be much easier to detect and therefore implausible.<ref name=""ProliferationRisk_Goldston"" />
* ''Modifications to produce weapon-usable material in a commercial facility:'' The production potential is significant. But no fertile or fissile substances necessary for the production of weapon-usable materials needs to be present at a civil fusion system at all. If not shielded, a detection of these materials can be done by their characteristic gamma radiation. The underlying redesign could be detected by regular design information verifications. In the (technically more feasible) case of solid breeder blanket modules, it would be necessary for incoming components to be inspected for the presence of fertile material,<ref name=""ProliferationRisk_Goldston"" /> otherwise plutonium for several weapons could be produced each year.<ref name=""StrongNeutronSources"" />
* ''Prioritizing a fast production of weapon-grade material regardless of secrecy:'' The fastest way to produce weapon usable material was seen in modifying a prior civil fusion power station. Unlike in some nuclear power stations, there is no weapon compatible material during civil use. Even without the need for covert action this modification would still take about 2 months to start the production and at least an additional week to generate a significant amount for weapon production. This was seen as enough time to detect a military use and to react with diplomatic or military means. To stop the production, a military destruction of inevitable parts of the facility leaving out the reactor itself would be sufficient. This, together with the intrinsic safety of fusion power would only bear a low risk of radioactive contamination.<ref name=""ProliferationRisk_Goldston"" />

Another study concludes that ""[..]large fusion reactors – even if not designed for fissile material breeding – could easily produce several hundred kg Pu per year with high weapon quality and very low source material requirements."" It was emphasized that the implementation of features for intrinsic proliferation resistance might only be possible at this phase of research and development.<ref name=""StrongNeutronSources"" /> The theoretical and computational tools needed for hydrogen bomb design are closely related to those needed for [[inertial confinement fusion]], but have very little in common with the more scientifically developed [[magnetic confinement fusion]].

=== Energy source ===
Large-scale reactors using neutronic fuels (e.g. [[ITER]]) and thermal power production (turbine based) are most comparable to [[nuclear power|fission power]] from an engineering and economics viewpoint. Both fission and fusion power stations involve a relatively compact heat source powering a conventional steam turbine-based power station, while producing enough neutron radiation to make [[neutron activation|activation]] of the station materials problematic. The main distinction is that fusion power produces no high-level radioactive waste (though activated station materials still need to be disposed of). There are some power station ideas that may significantly lower the cost or size of such stations; however, research in these areas is nowhere near as advanced as in [[tokamak]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Fusion power commonly proposes the use of [[deuterium]], an [[isotope]] of hydrogen, as fuel and in many current designs also use [[lithium]]. Assuming a fusion energy output equal to the 1995 global power output of about 100 [[exa-|E]]J/yr (= 1 × 10<sup>20</sup> J/yr) and that this does not increase in the future, which is unlikely, then the known current lithium reserves would last 3000 years. Lithium from sea water would last 60 million years, however, and a more complicated fusion process using only deuterium from sea water would have fuel for 150 billion years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agci.org/dB/PDFs/03S2_MMauel_SafeFusion%3F.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727135814/http://www.agci.org/dB/PDFs/03S2_MMauel_SafeFusion?.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-27 |title=Energy for Future Centuries |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-06-22 }}</ref> To put this in context, 150 billion years is close to 30 times the remaining lifespan of the sun,<ref name=""sunlife"">{{cite web|url=http://helios.gsfc.nasa.gov/qa_sun.html#sunlife|title=Cosmicopia|last= Eric Christian|display-authors=etal|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2009-03-20}}</ref> and more than 10 times the estimated age of the universe.

== Economics ==
While fusion power is still in early stages of development, substantial sums have been and continue to be invested in research. In the EU almost {{nowrap|€10 billion}} was spent on fusion research up to the end of the 1990s, and the new [[ITER]] reactor alone is budgeted at {{nowrap|€6.6 billion total for the timeframe between 2008 and 2020.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.f4e.europa.eu |title=Fusion For Energy - Bringing the power of the sun to earth |author=Fusion For Energy |work=f4e.europa.eu}}</ref>}}

It is estimated that up to the point of possible implementation of electricity generation by nuclear fusion, R&D will need further promotion totalling around {{nowrap|€60–80 billion}} over a period of {{nowrap|50 years}} or so (of which {{nowrap|€20–30 billion}} within the EU) based on a report from 2002.<ref>{{cite news |title=The current EU research programme |format=PDF |work=[[Sixth Framework Programme|FP6]] |publisher=Tab Beim Bundestag (tab.fzk.de) |url=https://www.tab-beim-bundestag.de/en/pdf/publications/summarys/TAB-Arbeitsbericht-ab075_Z.pdf |accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref> Nuclear fusion research receives {{nowrap|€750 million}} (excluding ITER funding) from the European Union, compared with {{nowrap|€810 million}} for sustainable energy research,<ref>{{cite web |title=The Sixth Framework Programme in brief |format=PDF |publisher=ec.europa.eu |url= http://ec.europa.eu/research/fp6/pdf/fp6-in-brief_en.pdf |accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref> putting research into fusion power well ahead of that of any single rivaling technology. Indeed, the size of the investments and time frame of the expected results mean that fusion research is almost exclusively publicly funded, while research in other forms of energy can be done by the private sector. In spite of that, a number of start-up companies active in the field of fusion power have managed to attract private money.<ref>{{cite news |last=Grossman |first=Lev |title=Star power |publisher=Time |url=http://time.com/magazine/us/4082927/november-2nd-2015-vol-186-no-18-u-s/ |date=November 2, 2015}}</ref>

Despite being technically [[non-renewable energy|non-renewable]], fusion power has many of the benefits of renewable energy sources (such as being a long-term energy supply and emitting no [[greenhouse gas]]es) as well as some of the benefits of the resource-limited energy sources as hydrocarbons and nuclear fission (without [[Nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]]). Like these currently dominant energy sources, fusion could provide very high power-generation density and uninterrupted power delivery (because it is not dependent on the [[weather]], unlike wind and solar power).{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Another aspect of fusion energy is that the cost of production does not suffer from [[diseconomies of scale]]. The cost of water and wind energy, for example, goes up as the optimal locations are developed first, while further generators must be sited in less ideal conditions. With fusion energy the production cost will not increase much even if large numbers of stations are built, because the raw resource (seawater) is abundant and widespread.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Some problems that are expected to be an issue in this century, such as [[water resources|fresh water shortages]], can alternatively be regarded as problems of energy supply. For example, in [[desalination]] stations, [[seawater]] can be purified through [[distillation]] or [[reverse osmosis]]. Nonetheless, these processes are energy intensive. Even if the first fusion stations are not competitive with alternative sources, fusion could still become competitive if large-scale desalination requires more power than the alternatives are able to provide.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

A scenario has been presented of the effect of the commercialization of fusion power on the future of human civilization.<ref>{{cite web

Using this as the starting point and the history of the uptake of nuclear fission reactors as a guide, the scenario depicts a rapid take up of nuclear fusion energy starting after the middle of this century.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Fusion power could be used in [[interstellar space]], where solar energy is not available.<ref>{{cite web

54838,2017-08-26 02:51:00-05,Biogas,"'''Biogas''' typically refers to a mixture of different [[gas]]es produced by the breakdown of [[organic matter]] in the absence of oxygen. Biogas can be produced from raw materials such as agricultural waste, [[manure]], [[municipal waste]], [[plant material]], [[sewage]], [[green waste]] or [[food waste]]. Biogas is a renewable energy source.

Biogas can be produced by [[anaerobic digestion]] with [[anaerobic organism]]s, which digest material inside a closed system, or [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] of biodegradable materials.<ref>[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]. [http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/publications/nnfcc-renewable-fuels-and-energy-factsheet-anaerobic-digestion ""NNFCC Renewable Fuels and Energy Factsheet: Anaerobic Digestion""], Retrieved on 2011-02-16</ref>

Biogas is primarily [[methane]] ({{chem|CH|4}}) and [[carbon dioxide]] ({{ CO2}}) and may have small amounts of [[hydrogen sulfide]] ({{chem|H|2|S}}), moisture and [[siloxane]]s. The gases [[methane]], [[hydrogen]], and [[carbon monoxide]] ({{chem|CO}}) can be combusted or oxidized with oxygen. This energy release allows biogas to be used as a fuel; it can be used for any heating purpose, such as cooking. It can also be used in a gas engine to convert the energy in the gas into electricity and heat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clarke-energy.com/gas-type/biogas/ |title=Biogas & Engines|publisher=, www.clarke-energy.com|accessdate=  21 November 2011}}</ref>

Biogas can be compressed, the same way as [[natural gas]] is compressed to [[compressed natural gas|CNG]], and used to power [[Alternative fuel vehicle|motor vehicles]]. In the UK, for example, biogas is estimated to have the potential to replace around 17% of vehicle fuel.<ref name=""claverton-energy.com"">{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/biomethane-fueled-vehicles-the-carbon-neutral-option.html|title= Biomethane fueled vehicles the carbon neutral option|publisher= Claverton Energy Conference  Bath, UK|date= 24 October 2009}}</ref> It qualifies for renewable [[energy subsidies]] in some parts of the world. Biogas can be cleaned and upgraded to natural gas standards, when it becomes bio-methane. Biogas is considered to be a renewable resource because its production-and-use cycle is continuous, and it generates no net carbon dioxide. Organic material grows, is converted and used and then regrows in a continually repeating cycle. From a carbon perspective, as much carbon dioxide is absorbed from the atmosphere in the growth of the primary bio-resource as is released when the material is ultimately converted to energy.

==Production==
{{Main article|Anaerobic digestion}}
[[File:Biogasanlage-01.jpg|thumb|Biogas production in rural Germany]]

Biogas is produced as [[landfill gas]] (LFG), which is produced by the breakdown of [[Biodegradable waste]] inside a landfill due to chemical reactions and microbes, or as digested gas, produced inside an [[anaerobic digestion|anaerobic digester]]. A ''biogas plant'' is the name often given to an [[anaerobic digester]] that treats farm wastes or energy crops. It can be produced using anaerobic digesters (air-tight tanks with different configurations). These plants can be fed with energy crops such as maize [[silage]] or [[biodegradable waste]]s including sewage sludge and food waste. During the process, the microorganisms transform biomass waste into biogas (mainly methane and carbon dioxide) and [[digestate]]. The biogas is a renewable energy that can be used for heating, electricity, and many other operations that use a reciprocating internal combustion engine, such as [[GE Jenbacher]] or [[Caterpillar]] gas engines.<ref>State Energy Conservation Office (Texas). [http://www.seco.cpa.state.tx.us/re_biomass-manure.htm ""Biomass Energy: Manure for Fuel.""], 23 April 2009. Web. 3 October 2009.</ref> Other internal combustion engines such as gas turbines are suitable for the conversion of biogas into both electricity and heat. The digestate is the remaining inorganic matter that was  not transformed into biogas. It can be used as an agricultural fertiliser.

There are two key processes: [[mesophilic]] and [[thermophilic]] digestion which is dependent on temperature. In experimental work at [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]], a 1000-litre digester using [[psychrophiles]] harvested from ""mud from a frozen lake in Alaska"" has produced 200–300&nbsp;liters of methane per day, about 20%–30% of the output from digesters in warmer climates.<ref name=""NewSc2785p14"">{{cite news

=== Dangers ===
The dangers of biogas are mostly similar to those of [[natural gas]], but with an additional risk from the toxicity of its [[hydrogen sulfide]] fraction. Biogas can be explosive when mixed in the ratio of one part biogas to 8-20 parts air. Special safety precautions have to be taken for entering an empty biogas digester for maintenance work.

It is important that a biogas system never has negative pressure as this could cause an explosion. Negative gas pressure can occur if too much gas is removed or leaked; Because of this biogas should not be used at pressures below one column inch of water, measured by a pressure   gauge.

Frequent smell checks must be performed on a biogas system. If biogas is smelled anywhere windows and doors should be opened immediately. If there is a fire the gas should be shut off at the gate valve of the biogas system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://werkgroepterlinden.be/Biogas.html|title=BIOGAS PROBLEMS|   publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref>

== Landfill gas ==
{{Main article|Landfill gas}}
Landfill gas is produced by wet organic waste decomposing under anaerobic conditions in a biogas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bioenergy.org.nz/biogas.asp |title=Biogas - Bioenergy Association of New Zealand (BANZ) |publisher=Bioenergy.org.nz |date=29  2006 |accessdate=21 February 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.epa.gov/lmop/proj/ LFG energy projects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103070211/http://www.epa.gov/lmop/proj/ |date=3 January 2009 }}</ref>

The waste is covered and mechanically compressed by the weight of the material that is deposited above. This material prevents oxygen exposure thus allowing anaerobic microbes to thrive. Biogas builds up and is slowly released into the atmosphere if the site has not been engineered to capture the gas. Landfill gas released in an uncontrolled way can be hazardous since it can become explosive when it escapes from the landfill and mixes with oxygen. The lower explosive limit is 5% methane and the upper is 15% methane.<ref>[http://www.adelaide.edu.au/biogas/safety/ Safety Page, Beginners Guide to Biogas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217044037/http://www.adelaide.edu.au/biogas/safety/ |date=17 February 2015 }}, www.adelaide.edu.au/biogas. Retrieved 22.10.07.</ref>

The methane in biogas is 20 times more potent a [[greenhouse gas]] than carbon dioxide. Therefore, uncontained landfill gas, which escapes into the atmosphere may significantly contribute to the effects of [[global warming]]. In addition, [[volatile organic compound]]s (VOCs) in landfill gas contribute to the formation of [[Smog#Photochemical smog|photochemical smog]].

===Technical===

[[Biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD) is a measure of the amount of oxygen required by aerobic micro-organisms to decompose the organic matter in a sample of aterial being used in the biodigester as well as the BOD for the liquid discharge allows for the calculation of the daily energy output from a biodigester.

Another term related to biodigesters is effluent dirtiness, which tells how much organic material there is per unit of biogas source. Typical units for this measure are in mg BOD/litre. As an example, effluent dirtiness can range between 800–1200&nbsp;mg BOD/litre in Panama.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

From 1&nbsp;kg of decommissioned kitchen bio-waste, 0.45 m³ of biogas can be obtained. The price for collecting biological waste from households is approximately €70 per ton.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Obrecht|first1=Matevz|last2=Denac|first2=Matjaz|title=Biogas - a sustainable energy source: new measures and possibilities for SLovenia|journal=Journal of Energy Technology|date=2011|issue=5|pages=11–24|url=http://www.fe.um.si/images/jet/jet4-5-internet.pdf}}</ref>

The composition of biogas varies depending upon the substrate composition, as well as the conditions within the anaerobic reactor (temperature, pH, and substrate concentration).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/biogas/vignettes/predBg_function.pdf|title=Predicting methane and biogas production with the biogas package|last=Hafner|first=Sasha|date=2017|website=CRAN|access-date=}}</ref> [[Landfill gas]] typically has methane concentrations around 50%.

In some cases, biogas contains [[siloxanes]]. They are formed from the [[anaerobic decomposition]] of materials commonly found in soaps and detergents. During combustion of biogas containing siloxanes, [[silicon]] is released and can combine with free oxygen or other elements in the [[combustion gas]]. Deposits are formed containing mostly [[silica]] ({{chem|SiO|2}}) or [[silicates]] ({{chem|Si|''x''|O|''y''}}) and can contain [[calcium]], [[sulfur]], [[zinc]], [[phosphorus]]. Such ''white mineral'' deposits accumulate to a surface thickness of several millimeters and must be removed by chemical or mechanical means.

Practical and cost-effective technologies to remove siloxanes and other biogas contaminants are available.<ref name=""BiogasSiloxaneRemoval"">{{Cite web |url=http://biogas-digester.com/biogas-technology-lowers-costs.html|title=New Landfill Gas Treatment Technology Dramatically Lowers Energy Production Costs|last=Tower|first=P.|author2=Wetzel, J. |author3=Lombard, X. |date=March 2006|publisher=Applied Filter Technology|accessdate=30 April 2009}}(broken link)</ref>

For 1000&nbsp;kg (wet weight) of input to a typical biodigester, total solids may be 30% of the wet weight while [[volatile suspended solids]] may be 90% of the total solids. Protein would be 20% of the volatile solids, carbohydrates would be 70% of the volatile solids, and finally fats would be 10% of the volatile solids.

==Benefits of manure derived biogas==
High levels of [[methane]] are produced when manure is stored under anaerobic conditions. During storage and when manure has been applied to the land, [[nitrous oxide]] is also produced as a byproduct of the denitrification process. Nitrous oxide ({{chem|N|2O}}) is 320 times more aggressive as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide<ref>''[http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/lead/toolbox/indust/ghgas.htm Increased Greenhouse Gas Emissions]'', Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations''</ref> and methane 25 times more than carbon dioxide.<ref>''[http://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/gases/ch4.html Overview of Greenhouse Gases, Methane Emissions].'' Climate Change, United States Environmental Protection Agency, 11 December 2015.</ref>

By converting cow manure into methane biogas via [[anaerobic digestion]], the millions of cattle in the United States would be able to produce 100 billion kiloWatt hours of electricity, enough to power millions of homes across the United States. In fact, one cow can produce enough manure in one day to generate 3 kiloWatt hours of electricity; only 2.4 kiloWatt hours of electricity are needed to power a single 100-Watt light bulb for one day.<ref>State Energy Conservation Office (Texas). ""Biomass Energy: Manure for Fuel."" State Energy Conservation Office (Texas). State of Texas, 23 April 2009. Web. 3 October 2009.</ref> Furthermore, by converting cattle manure into methane biogas instead of letting it decompose, global warming gases could be reduced by 99 million metric tons or 4%.<ref>Webber, Michael E and Amanda D Cuellar.

===Biogas upgrading===
Raw biogas produced from digestion is roughly 60% methane and 29% {{chem|CO|2}} with trace elements of {{chem|H|2|S}}; it is not of high enough quality to be used as fuel gas for machinery. The corrosive nature of {{chem|H|2|S}} alone is enough to destroy the internals of a plant.<ref name=""AbatzoglouBoivin2009"">{{cite journal|last1=Abatzoglou|first1=Nicolas|last2=Boivin|first2=Steve|title=A review of biogas purification processes|journal=Biofuels, Bioproducts and Biorefining|volume=3|issue=1|year=2009|pages=42–71|issn=1932-104X|doi=10.1002/bbb.117}}</ref><ref name=""HuertasGiraldo2011"">{{cite journal|last1=Huertas|first1=J.I.|last2=Giraldo|first2=N.|last3=Izquierdo|first3=S.|title=Removal of H2S and CO2 from Biogas by Amine Absorption|year=2011|doi=10.5772/20039|journal=Mass Transfer in Chemical Engineering Processes}}</ref>

Methane in biogas can be concentrated via a [[biogas upgrader]] to the same standards as fossil [[natural gas]], which itself has to go through a cleaning process, and becomes ''biomethane''. If the local gas network allows, the producer of the biogas may use their distribution networks. Gas must be very clean to reach pipeline quality and must be of the correct composition for the distribution network to accept. [[Carbon dioxide]], [[water]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], and [[particulate]]s must be removed if present.<ref name=""AbatzoglouBoivin2009""/>

There are four main methods of upgrading: water washing, pressure swing adsorption, selexol adsorption, and [[amine gas treating]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sgc.se/dokument/Evaluation.pdf|title=Nyheter - SGC|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref> In addition to these, the use of membrane separation technology for biogas upgrading is increasing, and there are already several plants operating in Europe and USA.<ref name=""AbatzoglouBoivin2009""/><ref>[http://www.iea-biogas.net/files/daten-redaktion/download/publi-task37/upgrading_rz_low_final.pdf Petersson A., Wellinger A.

IEA Bioenergy Task 37] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129031426/http://www.iea-biogas.net/files/daten-redaktion/download/publi-task37/upgrading_rz_low_final.pdf |date=29 November 2014 }}</ref>

The most prevalent method is water washing where high pressure gas flows into a column where the carbon dioxide and other trace elements are scrubbed by cascading water running counter-flow to the gas. This arrangement could deliver 98% methane with manufacturers guaranteeing maximum 2% methane loss in the system. It takes roughly between 3% and 6% of the total energy output in gas to run a biogas upgrading system.

===Biogas gas-grid injection===
Gas-grid injection is the [[wikt:injection|injection]] of biogas into the [[methane grid]] ([[natural gas grid]]). Injections includes biogas<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgrid.com/corporate/About+Us/climate/press/020209.htm|title=National Grid: Half Britain’s homes could be heated by renewable gas, says National Grid|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref> until the breakthrough of [[micro combined heat and power]] two-thirds of all the energy produced by [[Anaerobic digestion|biogas power plant]]s was lost (the heat), using the grid to transport the gas to customers, the electricity and the heat can be used for [[Distributed generation|on-site generation]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea//news/article/2008/07/biogas-flows-through-germanys-grid-big-time-53075 |title=Biogas Flows Through Germany's Grid Big Time - Renewable Energy News Article |date=14 March 2012 |publisher= |accessdate=17 June 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314003328/http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea//news/article/2008/07/biogas-flows-through-germanys-grid-big-time-53075 |archivedate=14 March 2012 }}</ref> resulting in a reduction of losses in the transportation of energy. Typical energy losses in natural gas transmission systems range from 1% to 2%.

===Biogas in transport===
[[File:Biogas-train-amanda-in-linkoping-2006.JPG|thumb|250px|""Biogaståget Amanda"" (""Amanda the Biogas Train"") train near [[Linköping]] station, Sweden]]
If concentrated and compressed, it can be used in vehicle transportation. Compressed biogas is becoming widely used in [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], and Germany. A biogas-powered train, named Biogaståget Amanda (The Biogas Train Amanda), has been in service in Sweden since 2005.<ref>[http://www.svenskbiogas.se/sb/docs/english/Biogastrain_produktblad_2005.pdf Biogas train in Sweden] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929143008/http://www.svenskbiogas.se/sb/docs/english/Biogastrain_produktblad_2005.pdf |date=29 September 2011 }}</ref><ref>Friendly fuel trains (30 October 2005) [[New Straits Times]], p.

===Measuring in biogas environments===
Biogas is part of the wet gas and condensing gas (or air) category that includes mist or fog in the gas stream. The mist or fog is predominately water vapor that condenses on the sides of pipes or stacks throughout the gas flow. Biogas environments include wastewater digesters, landfills, and animal feeding operations (covered livestock lagoons).

Ultrasonic flow meters are one of the few devices capable of measuring in a biogas atmosphere. Most of thermal flow meters are unable to provide reliable data because the moisture causes steady high flow readings and continuous flow spiking, although there are single-point insertion thermal mass flow meters capable of accurately monitoring biogas flows with minimal pressure drop. They can handle moisture variations that occur in the flow stream because of daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations, and account for the moisture in the flow stream to produce a dry gas value.

==Legislation==

===European Union===
The European Union has legislation regarding waste management and landfill sites called the [[Landfill Directive]].

Countries such as the United Kingdom and Germany now have legislation in force that provides farmers with long-term revenue and energy security.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.alfagy.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=77&Itemid=72 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707110323/http://www.alfagy.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=77&Itemid=72 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 July 2011 |title=CHP &#124; Combined Heat and Power &#124; Cogeneration &#124; Wood Biomass Gasified Co-generation &#124; Energy Efficiency &#124; Electricity Generation |publisher=Alfagy.com |accessdate=21 February 2010}}</ref>

===United States===
The United States legislates against landfill gas as it contains [[Volatile organic compound|VOCs]]. The United States [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] and [[Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations]] (CFR) requires landfill owners to estimate the quantity of non-methane organic compounds (NMOCs) emitted. If the estimated NMOC emissions exceeds 50 tonnes per year, the landfill owner is required to collect the gas and treat it to remove the entrained NMOCs. Treatment of the landfill gas is usually by combustion. Because of the remoteness of landfill sites, it is sometimes not economically feasible to produce electricity from the gas.

==Global developments==

=== United States ===
With the many benefits of biogas, it is starting to become a popular source of energy and is starting to be used in the United States more. In 2003, the United States consumed 147 trillion BTU of energy from ""landfill gas"", about 0.6% of the total U.S. natural gas consumption.<ref name=""What is biogas"">[http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/fuels/emerging_biogas_what_is.html What is biogas?], U.S. Department of Energy, 13 April 2010</ref> Methane biogas derived from cow manure is being tested in the U.S. According to a 2008 study, collected by the ''Science and Children'' magazine, methane biogas from cow manure would be sufficient to produce 100 billion [[kilowatt hour]]s enough to power millions of homes across America. Furthermore, methane biogas has been tested to prove that it can reduce 99 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions or about 4% of the greenhouse gases produced by the United States.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Cuellar, Amanda D and Michael E Webber|title=Cow power: the energy and emissions benefits of converting manure to biogas|year=2008 |journal=Environ.

In Vermont, for example, biogas generated on dairy farms was included in the CVPS Cow Power program. The program was originally offered by Central Vermont Public Service Corporation as a voluntary tariff and now with a recent merger with Green Mountain Power is now the GMP Cow Power Program. Customers can elect to pay a premium on their electric bill, and that premium is passed directly to the farms in the program. In [[Sheldon, Vermont]], Green Mountain Dairy has provided renewable energy as part of the Cow Power program. It started when the brothers who own the farm, Bill and Brian Rowell, wanted to address some of the manure management challenges faced by dairy farms, including manure odor, and nutrient availability for the crops they need to grow to feed the animals. They installed an anaerobic digester to process the cow and milking center waste from their 950 cows to produce renewable energy, a bedding to replace sawdust, and a plant-friendly fertilizer. The energy and environmental attributes are sold to the GMP Cow Power program. On average, the system run by the Rowells produces enough electricity to power 300 to 350 other homes. The generator capacity is about 300 kilowatts.<ref>Zezima, Katie. ""[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/24/business/businessspecial2/24farmers.html Electricity From What Cows Leave Behind].""

In [[Hereford, Texas]], cow manure is being used to power an [[ethanol fuel|ethanol power]] plant. By switching to methane biogas, the ethanol power plant has saved 1000 barrels of oil a day. Over all, the power plant has reduced transportation costs and will be opening many more jobs for future power plants that will rely on biogas.<ref>State Energy Conservation Office (Texas).

In [[Oakley, Kansas]], an ethanol plant considered to be one of the largest biogas facilities in North America is using [[Integrated Manure Utilization System]] ""IMUS"" to produce heat for its boilers by utilizing feedlot manure, municipal organics and ethanol plant waste. At full capacity the plant is expected to replace 90% of the fossil fuel used in the manufacturing process of ethanol.<ref>Trash-to-energy trend boosts anaerobic digesters [http://finance-commerce.com/2013/10/trash-to-energy-trend-boosts-anaerobic-digesters/].""</ref><ref>Western Plains Energy finishing up North America’s largest biogas digester [http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2013/03/13/western-plains-energy-finishing-up-north-americas-largest-biogas-digester/].""</ref>

=== Europe ===
The level of development varies greatly in Europe. While countries such as Germany, Austria and Sweden are fairly advanced in their use of biogas, there is a vast potential for this renewable energy source in the rest of the continent, especially in Eastern Europe. Different legal frameworks, education schemes and the availability of technology are among the prime reasons behind this untapped potential.<ref name=""SEBE Website"">{{cite web|url=http://www.sebe2013.eu |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20141128141840/http://www.sebe2013.eu/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 November 2014 |title=About SEBE |publisher= |accessdate=15 May 2015 }}</ref> Another challenge for the further progression of biogas has been negative public perception.

In February 2009, the European Biogas Association (EBA) was founded in Brussels as a non-profit organisation to promote the deployment of sustainable biogas production and use in Europe. EBA's strategy defines three priorities: establish biogas as an important part of Europe’s energy mix, promote source separation of household waste to increase the gas potential, and support the production of biomethane as vehicle fuel. In July 2013, it had 60 members from 24 countries across Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://european-biogas.eu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2&Itemid=4|title=European Biogas Association|work=European Biogas Association|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref>

=== UK ===
{{As of|September 2013}}, there are about 130 non-sewage biogas plants in the UK. Most are on-farm, and some larger facilities exist off-farm, which are taking food and consumer wastes.<ref>The Official Information Portal on AD [http://www.biogas-info.co.uk/index.php/ad-map.html 'Biogas Plant Map']</ref>

On 5 October 2010, biogas was injected into the UK gas grid for the first time. Sewage from over 30,000 Oxfordshire homes is sent to Didcot [[sewage treatment]] works, where it is treated in an anaerobic digestor to produce biogas, which is then cleaned to provide gas for approximately 200 homes.<ref>Sewage project sends first ever renewable gas to grid [http://www.thameswater.co.uk/cps/rde/xchg/corp/hs.xsl/10982.htm Thames Water]</ref>

In 2015 the Green-Energy company [[Ecotricity]] announced their plans to build three grid-injecting digesters.

Biogas in Germany is primarily extracted by the co-fermentation of energy crops (called 'NawaRo', an abbreviation of ''nachwachsende Rohstoffe'', German for renewable resources) mixed with manure. The main crop used is corn. Organic waste and industrial and agricultural residues such as waste from the food industry are also used for biogas generation.<ref name=""Wieland, P. 2003"">{{cite journal|last=Wieland|first=P.|title=Production and Energetic Use of Biogas from Energy Crops and Wastes in Germany|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/p01720g04122n251/fulltext.pdf|journal=Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology|accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref> In this respect, biogas production in Germany differs significantly from the UK, where biogas generated from landfill sites is most common.<ref name=""Eurobserv'er 2010""/>

Biogas production in Germany has developed rapidly over the last 20 years. The main reason is the legally created frameworks. Government support of renewable energy started in 1991 with the Electricity Feed-in Act (''StrEG''). This law guaranteed the producers of energy from renewable sources the feed into the public power grid, thus the power companies were forced to take all produced energy from independent private producers of green energy.<ref name=""IfnE et al. 2009"">{{cite web |title=Erneuerbare Energien in Deutschland.

This law even guaranteed a fixed compensation for the produced electric power over 20 years. The amount of around 8{{nbsp}}¢/kWh gave farmers the opportunity to become energy suppliers and gain a further source of income.<ref name=""Wieland, P. 2003"" />

The German agricultural biogas production was given a further push in 2004 by implementing the so-called NawaRo-Bonus. This is a special payment given for the use of renewable resources, that is, energy crops.<ref name=""Wieland, P. 2006"">{{cite journal|last=Wieland|first=P.|title=Biomass Digestion in Agriculture: A Successful Pathway for the Energy Production and Waste Treatment in Germany|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/elsc.2006 20128/pdf|publisher=Engineering in Life Science |accessdate=5 November 2011|doi=10.1002/elsc.2006_20128}}</ref> In 2007 the German government stressed its intention to invest further effort and support in improving the renewable energy supply to provide an answer on growing climate challenges and increasing oil prices by the ‘Integrated Climate and Energy Programme’.

This continual trend of renewable energy promotion induces a number of challenges facing the management and organisation of renewable energy supply that has also several impacts on the biogas production.<ref name=""Kanning et al. 2009"">{{cite web|last=Kanning|first=H.|title=Erneuerbare Energien - Räumliche Dimensionen, neue Akteurslandschaften und planerische (Mit)Gestaltungspotenziale am Beispiel des Biogaspfades|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/907371418487t402/fulltext.pdf|publisher=Raumforschung und Raumordnung|accessdate=5 November 2011|display-authors=etal}}</ref> The first challenge to be noticed is the high area-consuming of the biogas electric power supply. In 2011 energy crops for biogas production consumed an area of circa 800,000 ha in Germany.<ref name=""FNR 2011"">{{cite web|title=Cultivation of renewable Resources in Germany|url=http://www.nachwachsenderohstoffe.de/fileadmin/fnr/images/aktuelles/grafiken /FNR510_Grafik_Anbau_2011_engl__300_rgb.jpg|publisher=FNR|accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref> This high demand of agricultural areas generates new competitions with the food industries that did not exist hitherto. Moreover, new industries and markets were created in predominately rural regions entailing different new players with an economic, political and civil background. Their influence and acting has to be governed to gain all advantages this new source of energy is offering. Finally biogas will furthermore play an important role in the German renewable energy supply if good governance is focused.<ref name=""Kanning et al. 2009"" />

=== Indian Subcontinent ===

Biogas in India<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpowersystems.co.in/waste-management-and-biogas/|title=GPS Renewables - Waste management through biogas - GPS Renewables|work=GPS Renewables|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref> has been traditionally based on dairy manure as feed stock and these ""gobar"" gas plants have been in operation for a long period of time, especially in rural India. In the last 2-3 decades, research organisations with a focus on rural energy security have enhanced the design of the systems resulting in newer efficient low cost designs such as the Deenabandhu model.

The Deenabandhu Model is a new biogas-production model popular in India. (''Deenabandhu'' means ""friend of the helpless."") The unit usually has a capacity of 2 to 3 cubic metres. It is constructed using bricks or by a [[ferrocement]] mixture. In India, the brick model costs slightly more than the ferrocement model; however, India's Ministry of New and Renewable Energy offers some subsidy per model constructed.

LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) is a key source of cooking fuel in urban India and its prices have been increasing along with the global fuel prices. Also the heavy subsidies provided by the successive governments in promoting LPG as a domestic cooking fuel has become a financial burden renewing the focus on biogas as a cooking fuel alternative in urban establishments. This has led to the development of prefabricated digester for modular deployments as compared to RCC and cement structures which take a longer duration to construct. Renewed focus on process technology like the Biourja process model<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpowersystems.co.in/monitoring-methodology/|title=GPS Renewables - Monitoring Methodology - GPS Renewables|work=GPS Renewables|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref> has enhanced the stature of medium and large scale anaerobic digester in India as a potential alternative to LPG as primary cooking fuel.

In India, Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh biogas produced from the anaerobic digestion of [[manure]] in small-scale digestion facilities is called [[Biogas#Gobar gas|gobar gas]]; it is estimated that such facilities exist in over 2 million households in India, 50,000 in Bangladesh and thousands in Pakistan, particularly North Punjab, due to the thriving population of livestock. The digester is an airtight circular pit made of concrete with a pipe connection. The manure is directed to the pit, usually straight from the cattle shed. The pit is filled with a required quantity of [[wastewater]]. The gas pipe is connected to the kitchen fireplace through control valves. The combustion of this biogas has very little odour or smoke. Owing to simplicity in implementation and use of cheap raw materials in villages, it is one of the most environmentally sound energy sources for rural needs. One type of these system is the Sintex Digester. Some designs use [[vermiculture]] to further enhance the slurry produced by the biogas plant for use as compost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ashdenawards.org/winners/skgsangha|title=Biogas plants provide cooking and fertiliser|work=Ashden Awards, sustainable and renewable energy in the UK and developing world|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref>

To create awareness and associate the people interested in biogas, the Indian Biogas Association<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biogas-india.com|title=Biogas-india - Home|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref> was formed. It aspires to be a unique blend of nationwide operators, manufacturers and planners of biogas plants, and representatives from science and research. The association was founded in 2010 and is now ready to start mushrooming. Its motto is ""propagating Biogas in a sustainable way"".

In Pakistan, the Rural Support Programmes Network is running the Pakistan Domestic Biogas Programme<ref name=""pakenergysolution"">{{cite web|url=http://www.pakenergysolution.com/|title=PAK-ENERGY SOLUTION|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref> which has installed 5,360 biogas plants<ref name=""PakBioGasPlants"">{{cite web|url=http://www.brecorder.com/pakistan/industries-a-sectors/213512-5360-bio-gas-plants-installed-in-12-districts.html|title=5,360 bio-gas plants installed in 12 districts|work=Business Recorder|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref> and has trained in excess of 200 masons on the technology and aims to develop the Biogas Sector in Pakistan.

In Nepal, the government provides subsidies to build biogas plant at home.

===China===
The Chinese have experimented with the applications of biogas since 1958. Around 1970, China had installed 6,000,000 digesters in an effort to make [[agriculture]] more efficient. During the last years the technology has met high growth rates. This seems to be the earliest developments in generating biogas from agricultural waste.<ref>[http://ecotippingpoints.org/our-stories/indepth/china-biogas.html Biogas in China.  Retrieved 27 October 2016]</ref>

===In developing nations===
Domestic biogas plants convert livestock manure and night soil into biogas and slurry, the fermented manure. This technology is feasible for small-holders with livestock producing 50&nbsp;kg manure per day, an equivalent of about 6 pigs or 3 cows. This manure has to be collectable to mix it with water and feed it into the plant. Toilets can be connected. Another precondition is the temperature that affects the fermentation process. With an optimum at 36 C° the technology especially applies for those living in a (sub) tropical climate. This makes the technology for small holders in developing countries often suitable.<ref name=""Roubík"">{{Cite journal|last=Roubík|first=Hynek|last2=Mazancová|first2=Jana|last3=Banout|first3=Jan|last4=Verner|first4=Vladimír|date=2016-01-20|title=Addressing problems at small-scale biogas plants: a case study from central Vietnam|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652615013426|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|volume=112, Part 4|pages=2784–2792|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.09.114}}</ref>

== Society and culture ==

In the 1985 Australian film ''[[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome]]'' the post-apocalyptic settlement Barter town is powered by a central biogas system based upon a piggery. As well as providing electricity, methane is used to power Barter's vehicles.

""Cow Town"", written in the early 1940s, discuss the travails of a city vastly built on cow manure and the hardships brought upon by the resulting methane biogas. Carter McCormick, an engineer from a town outside the city, is sent in to figure out a way to utilize this gas to help power, rather than suffocate, the city.","==See also==

From [[hot springs]], geothermal energy has been used for bathing since [[Paleolithic]] times and for [[space heating]] since ancient Roman times, but it is now better known for [[electricity generation]]. Worldwide, 11,700 [[megawatts]] (MW) of geothermal power is online in 2013.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/about-bp/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy/review-by-energy-type/renewable-energy/geothermal-capacity.html |title=Geothermal capacity &#124; About BP &#124; BP Global |publisher=Bp.com |accessdate=2014-11-15}}</ref> An additional 28 gigawatts of direct [[geothermal heating]] capacity is installed for district heating, space heating, spas, industrial processes, desalination and agricultural applications as of 2010.<ref name=""IPCC""/>

Geothermal power is cost-effective, reliable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly,<ref>Glassley, William E. (2010). ''Geothermal Energy: Renewable Energy and the Environment'', CRC Press, {{ISBN|9781420075700}}.{{page needed|date=February 2014}}</ref> but has historically been limited to areas near [[tectonic plate boundaries]]. Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the range and size of viable resources, especially for applications such as home heating, opening a potential for widespread exploitation. Geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels.

The Earth's geothermal resources are theoretically more than adequate to supply humanity's energy needs, but only a very small fraction may be profitably exploited. Drilling and exploration for deep resources is very expensive. Forecasts for the future of geothermal power depend on assumptions about technology, energy prices, subsidies, plate boundary movement and interest rates. Pilot programs like EWEB's customer opt in Green Power Program<ref>[http://www.eweb.org/greenpower Green Power]. eweb.org</ref> show that customers would be willing to pay a little more for a renewable energy source like geothermal. But as a result of government assisted research and industry experience, the cost of generating geothermal power has decreased by 25% over the past two decades.<ref>{{Citation|last=Cothran|first=Helen|title=Energy Alternatives|year=2002|publisher=Greenhaven Press|isbn=0737709049}}{{page needed|date=February 2014}}</ref> In 2001, geothermal energy costs between two and ten US cents per kWh.<ref>{{Citation |doi=10.1016/S1364-0321(01)00002-8|title=Geothermal energy for the benefit of the people|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=5|issue=3|pages=299|year=2001|last1=Fridleifsson|first1=Ingvar B}}</ref>

Geothermal electric plants were traditionally built exclusively on the edges of tectonic plates where high temperature geothermal resources are available near the surface. The development of [[binary cycle power plant]]s and improvements in drilling and extraction technology enable [[enhanced geothermal systems]] over a much greater geographical range.<ref name=""INEL"" /> Demonstration projects are operational in [[Landau-Pfalz]], Germany, and [[Soultz-sous-Forêts]], France, while an earlier effort in [[Basel]], Switzerland was shut down [[Induced seismicity in Basel|after it triggered earthquakes]].

The [[thermal efficiency]] of geothermal electric plants is low, around 10–23%, because geothermal fluids do not reach the high temperatures of steam from boilers. The laws of [[thermodynamics]] limits the efficiency of [[Cycle efficiency|heat engines]] in extracting useful energy. Exhaust heat is wasted, unless it can be used directly and locally, for example in greenhouses, timber mills, and district heating. System efficiency does not materially affect operational costs as it would for plants that use fuel, but it does affect return on the capital used to build the plant. In order to produce more energy than the pumps consume, electricity generation requires relatively hot fields and specialized heat cycles.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Because geothermal power does not rely on variable sources of energy, unlike, for example, wind or solar, its [[capacity factor]] can be quite large – up to 96% has been demonstrated.<ref>

==Types==
Geothermal energy comes in either ''vapor-dominated'' or ''liquid-dominated'' forms. [[Larderello]] and [[The Geysers]] are vapor-dominated. Vapor-dominated sites offer temperatures from 240 to 300&nbsp;°C that produce superheated steam.

===Liquid-dominated plants===
Liquid-dominated reservoirs (LDRs) were more common with temperatures greater than {{convert|200|C}} and are found near young volcanoes surrounding the Pacific Ocean and in rift zones and hot spots. ''Flash plants'' are the common way to generate electricity from these sources. Pumps are generally not required, powered instead when the water turns to steam. Most wells generate 2-10 MWe. Steam is separated from liquid via cyclone separators, while the liquid is returned to the reservoir for reheating/reuse. As of 2013, the largest liquid system is [[Cerro Prieto]] in Mexico, which generates 750 MWe from temperatures reaching {{convert|350|C|F}}. The [[Salton Sea]] field in Southern California offers the potential of generating 2000 MWe.<ref name=sci2013/>

Lower temperature LDRs (120–200&nbsp;°C) require pumping. They are common in extensional terrains, where heating takes place via deep circulation along faults, such as in the Western US and Turkey. Water passes through a [[heat exchanger]] in a [[Rankine cycle]] binary plant. The water vaporizes an organic working fluid that drives a [[turbine]]. These binary plants originated in the Soviet Union in the late 1960s and predominate in new US plants. Binary plants have no emissions.<ref name=sci2013/><ref name=eere>[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/low_temperature_resources.html Low-Temperature and Co-produced Geothermal Resources].

===Thermal energy===
{{Main article|Geothermal heating|geothermal heat pump}}
Lower temperature sources produce the energy equivalent of 100M BBL per year. Sources with temperatures of 30–150&nbsp;°C are used without conversion to electricity as [[district heating]], [[greenhouse]]s, [[fisheries]], mineral recovery, industrial process heating and bathing in 75 countries. Heat pumps extract energy from shallow sources at 10–20&nbsp;°C in 43 countries for use in space heating and cooling. Home heating is the fastest-growing means of exploiting geothermal energy, with global annual growth rate of 30% in 2005<ref>

The remainder supported industrial and agricultural applications. Global installed capacity was 28&nbsp;GW, but capacity factors tend to be low (30% on average) since heat is mostly needed in winter.

Heat for these purposes may also be extracted from co-generation at a [[geothermal electrical plant]].

Heating is cost-effective at many more sites than electricity generation. At natural hot springs or [[geysers]], water can be piped directly into [[radiators]]. In hot, dry ground, [[earth tubes]] or [[downhole heat exchanger]]s can collect the heat. However, even in areas where the ground is colder than room temperature, heat can often be extracted with a geothermal heat pump more cost-effectively and cleanly than by conventional furnaces.<ref name=""strategic"" /> These devices draw on much shallower and colder resources than traditional geothermal techniques. They frequently combine functions, including [[air conditioning]], [[seasonal thermal energy storage]], [[solar energy]] collection, and electric heating. Heat pumps can be used for space heating essentially anywhere.

Iceland is the world leader in direct applications. Some 92.5% of its homes are heated with geothermal energy, saving Iceland over $100 million annually in avoided oil imports. [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]] has the world's biggest district heating system, often used to heat pathways and roads to hinder the accumulation of ice.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reykjavik: The ground heats the city - Danish Architecture Centre|url=http://www.dac.dk/en/dac-cities/sustainable-cities/all-cases/energy/reykjavik-the-ground-heats-the-city/}}</ref> Once known as the most polluted city in the world, it is now one of the cleanest.<ref>{{Citation|last=Pahl|first=Greg|title=The Citizen-Powered Energy Handbook: Community Solutions to a Global Crisis|year=2007|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|location=Vermont}}</ref>

===Enhanced geothermal===
{{Main article|Enhanced geothermal system}}
Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) actively inject water into wells to be heated and pumped back out. The water is injected under high pressure to expand existing rock fissures to enable the water to freely flow in and out. The technique was adapted from oil and gas extraction techniques. However, the geologic formations are deeper and no toxic chemicals are used, reducing the possibility of environmental damage. Drillers can employ [[directional drilling]] to expand the size of the reservoir.<ref name=sci2013/>

Small-scale EGS have been installed in the [[Rhine Graben]] at [[Soultz-sous-Forêts]] in France and at [[Landau]] and [[Insheim]] in Germany.<ref name=sci2013/>

==Economics==
Geothermal power requires no fuel (except for pumps), and is therefore immune to fuel cost fluctuations. However, capital costs are significant. Drilling accounts for over half the costs, and exploration of deep resources entails significant risks. A typical well doublet (extraction and injection wells) in [[Nevada]] can support 4.5 [[megawatt]]s (MW) and costs about $10&nbsp;million to drill, with a 20% failure rate.<ref name=""econ101"">

</ref> Direct heating applications can use much shallower wells with lower temperatures, so smaller systems with lower costs and risks are feasible. Residential geothermal heat pumps with a capacity of 10&nbsp;kilowatt (kW) are routinely installed for around $1–3,000 per&nbsp;kilowatt. District heating systems may benefit from economies of scale if demand is geographically dense, as in cities and greenhouses, but otherwise piping installation dominates capital costs. The capital cost of one such district heating system in [[Bavaria]] was estimated at somewhat over 1&nbsp;million&nbsp;€ per&nbsp;MW.<ref>In the Netherlands the number of greenhouses heated by geothermal energy is increasing fast.

Geothermal projects have several stages of development. Each phase has associated risks. At the early stages of reconnaissance and geophysical surveys, many projects are cancelled, making that phase unsuitable for traditional lending. Projects moving forward from the identification, exploration and exploratory drilling often trade equity for financing.<ref>

In addition to the internal heat flows, the top layer of the surface to a depth of {{convert|10|m|ft|sp=us}} is heated by solar energy during the summer, and releases that energy and cools during the winter.

Outside of the seasonal variations, the [[geothermal gradient]] of temperatures through the crust is 25–30&nbsp;°C (77–86&nbsp;°F) per kilometer of depth in most of the world. The conductive heat [[flux]] averages 0.1&nbsp;MW/km<sup>2</sup>. These values are much higher near tectonic plate boundaries where the crust is thinner. They may be further augmented by fluid circulation, either through [[magma conduit]]s, [[hot springs]], [[hydrothermal circulation]] or a combination of these.

A geothermal heat pump can extract enough heat from shallow ground anywhere in the world to provide home heating, but industrial applications need the higher temperatures of deep resources.<ref name=""utilization"" /> The thermal efficiency and profitability of electricity generation is particularly sensitive to temperature. The most demanding applications receive the greatest benefit from a high natural heat flux, ideally from using a [[hot spring]]. The next best option is to drill a well into a hot [[aquifer]]. If no adequate aquifer is available, an artificial one may be built by injecting water to [[hydraulically fracture]] the bedrock. This last approach is called [[hot dry rock geothermal energy]] in Europe, or [[enhanced geothermal systems]] in North America. Much greater potential may be available from this approach than from conventional tapping of natural aquifers.<ref name=""INEL"">

==Production==
According to the Geothermal Energy Association (GEA) installed geothermal capacity in the United States grew by 5%, or 147.05 MW, ce the last annual survey in March 2012. This increase came from seven geothermal projects that began production in 2012. GEA also revised its 2011 estimate of installed capacity upward by 128 MW, bringing current installed U.S. geothermal capacity to 3,386 MW.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://geo-energy.org/pressReleases/2013/GEA2013UpdateRelease.aspx |title=GEA Update Release 2013 |publisher=Geo-energy.org |date=2013-02-26 |accessdate=2013-10-09}}</ref>

==Renewability and sustainability==
Geothermal power is considered to be [[Renewable energy|renewable]] because any projected heat extraction is small compared to the Earth's heat content. The Earth has an internal heat content of [[1 E31 J|10<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;joules]] (3·10<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;TW·hr), approximately 100 billion times current (2010) worldwide annual energy consumption.<ref name=""IPCC"" /> About 20% of this is residual heat from [[planetary accretion]], and the remainder is attributed to higher radioactive decay rates that existed in the past.<ref name=""turcotte"">

Human extraction taps a minute fraction of the natural outflow, often without accelerating it.{{clarify|reason=When would tapping heat not accelerate the cooling? Minutely, yes, but still.|date=May 2015}}

Geothermal power is also considered to be [[Sustainable energy|sustainable]] thanks to its power to sustain the Earth’s intricate ecosystems. By using geothermal sources of energy present generations of humans will not endanger the capability of future generations to use their own resources to the same amount that those energy sources are presently used.<ref>{{Citation|title=Is Geothermal Energy Renewable and Sustainable|url=http://www.energyauditorhq.com/is-geothermal-energy-renewable-and-sustainable/|work=Energy Auditor: Your Headquarters For Smart Sustainable Living:|accessdate=9 August 2012}}</ref> Further, due to its low emissions geothermal energy is considered to have excellent potential for mitigation of global warming.

Even though geothermal power is globally sustainable, extraction must still be monitored to avoid local depletion.<ref name=""sustainability"" /> Over the course of decades, individual wells draw down local temperatures and water levels until a new equilibrium is reached with natural flows. The three oldest sites, at [[Larderello]], [[Wairakei]], and the Geysers have experienced reduced output because of local depletion. Heat and water, in uncertain proportions, were extracted faster than they were replenished. If production is reduced and water is reinjected, these wells could theoretically recover their full potential. Such mitigation strategies have already been implemented at some sites. The long-term sustainability of geothermal energy has been demonstrated at the Lardarello field in [[Italy]] since 1913, at the Wairakei field in [[New Zealand]] since 1958,<ref name=""Wairakei"">

Falling electricity production may be boosted through drilling additional supply boreholes, as at [[Poihipi Power Station|Poihipi]] and [[Ohaaki Power Station|Ohaaki]]. The [[Wairakei Power Station|Wairakei]] power station has been running much longer, with its first unit commissioned in November 1958, and it attained its peak generation of 173MW in 1965, but already the supply of high-pressure steam was faltering, in 1982 being derated to intermediate pressure and the station managing 157MW. Around the start of the 21st century it was managing about 150MW, then in 2005 two 8MW isopentane systems were added, boosting the station's output by about 14MW. Detailed data are unavailable, being lost due to re-organisations. One such re-organisation in 1996 causes the absence of early data for Poihipi (started 1996), and the gap in 1996/7 for Wairakei and Ohaaki; half-hourly data for Ohaaki's first few months of operation are also missing, as well as for most of Wairakei's history.

Direct geothermal heating systems contain pumps and compressors, which may consume energy from a polluting source. This [[parasitic load]] is normally a fraction of the heat output, so it is always less polluting than electric heating. However, if the electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels, then the net emissions of geothermal heating may be comparable to directly burning the fuel for heat. For example, a geothermal heat pump powered by electricity from a [[combined cycle]] [[natural gas]] plant would produce about as much pollution as a natural gas [[condensing furnace]] of the same size.<ref name=""strategic"">

==Legal frameworks==
Some of the legal issues raised by geothermal energy resources include questions of ownership and allocation of the resource, the grant of exploration permits, exploitation rights, royalties, and the extent to which geothermal energy issues have been recognized in existing planning and environmental laws. Other questions concern overlap between geothermal and mineral or petroleum tenements. Broader issues concern the extent to which the legal framework for encouragement of renewable energy assists in encouraging geothermal industry innovation and development.

4711003,2017-08-10 18:56:00-05,Osmotic power,"'''Osmotic power''', '''salinity gradient power''' or '''blue energy''' is the energy available from the difference in the salt concentration between [[seawater]] and [[fresh water|river water]].

[[pressure retarded osmosis]] (PRO). Both processes rely on [[osmosis]] with [[artificial membrane|membrane]]s. The key waste product is [[brackish water]]. This byproduct is the result of natural forces that are being harnessed: the flow of fresh water into seas that are made up of salt water.

==Basics of salinity gradient power==
[[Image:Blue energy mechanism.png|thumb|right|Pressure-retarded osmosis]]
Salinity gradient power is a specific renewable energy alternative that creates renewable and sustainable power by using naturally occurring processes. This practice does not contaminate or release [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions (vapor pressure methods will release dissolved air containing CO<sub>2</sub> at low pressures—these non-condensable gases can be re-dissolved of course, but with an energy penalty). Also as stated by Jones and Finley within their article “Recent Development in Salinity Gradient Power”, there is basically no fuel cost.

Salinity gradient energy is based on using the resources of “osmotic pressure difference between fresh water and sea water.”<ref>(Jones, A.T., W. Finley. “Recent developments in salinity gradient power”. Oceans. 2003. 2284-2287.)</ref> All energy that is proposed to use salinity gradient technology relies on the evaporation to separate water from salt. Osmotic pressure is the ""chemical potential of concentrated and dilute solutions of salt"".<ref>(Brauns, E. “Toward a worldwide sustainable and simultaneous large-scale production of renewable energy and potable water trough salinity gradient power by combining reversed electrodialysis and solar power?” Environmental Process and Technology. Jan 2007. 312-323.)</ref> When looking at relations between high osmotic pressure and low, solutions with higher concentrations of salt have higher pressure.

Differing salinity gradient power generations exist but one of the most commonly discussed is [[pressure-retarded osmosis]] (PRO). Within PRO seawater is pumped into a pressure chamber where the pressure is lower than the difference between fresh and salt water pressure. Fresh water moves in a semipermeable membrane and increases its volume in the chamber. As the pressure in the chamber is compensated a turbine spins to generate electricity. In Braun's article he states that this process is easy to understand in a more broken down manner. Two solutions, A being salt water and B being fresh water are separated by a membrane. He states ""only water molecules can pass the semipermeable membrane. As a result of the osmotic pressure difference between both solutions, the water from solution B thus will diffuse through the membrane in order to dilute solution A"".<ref>(Brauns, E. “Toward a worldwide sustainable and simultaneous large-scale production of renewable energy and potable water through salinity gradient power by combining reversed electrodialysis and solar power?.” ''Environmental Process and Technology''. Jan 2007. 312-323.)</ref> The pressure drives the turbines and power the generator that produces the electrical energy. Osmosis might be used directly to ""pump"" fresh water out of The Netherlands into the sea. This is currently done using electric pumps.

==Efficiency==
A 2012 study on efficiency from Yale university concluded that the highest extractable work in constant-pressure PRO with a seawater draw solution and river water feed solution is 0.75 kWh/m<sup>3</sup> while the free energy of mixing is 0.81 kWh/m<sup>3</sup>—a thermodynamic extraction efficiency of 91.0%.<ref>[http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es300060m] Thermodynamic and Energy Efficiency Analysis of Power Generation from Natural Salinity Gradients by Pressure Retarded Osmosis</ref>

==Methods==
While the mechanics and concepts of salinity gradient power are still being studied, the power source has been implemented in several different locations. Most of these are experimental, but thus far they have been predominantly successful. The various companies that have utilized this power have also done so in many different ways as there are several concepts and processes that harness the power from salinity gradient.

===Pressure-retarded osmosis===
[[File:Simplistic pressure retarded osmosis power generation diagram.jpg|thumb|right|Simple PRO power generation scheme]]
[[File:Hurum osmosis power 02.JPG|250px|thumbnail|right|Osmotic Power Prototype at Tofte (Hurum), Norway]]
One method to utilize salinity gradient energy is called [[pressure-retarded osmosis]].<ref>[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6TGK-4MDGP8H-1&_user=607017&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=607017&md5=acc4682fd086886dff4b0cb1ee6123df Salinity-gradient power: Evaluation of pressure-retarded osmosis and reverse electrodialysis]</ref> In this method, seawater is pumped into a pressure chamber that is at a pressure lower than the difference between the pressures of saline water and fresh water. Freshwater is also pumped into the pressure chamber through a membrane, which increase both the volume and pressure of the chamber. As the pressure differences are compensated, a turbine is spun, providing kinetic energy. This method is being specifically studied by the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[public utility|utility]] [[Statkraft]], which has calculated that up to 2.85 GW would be available from this process in Norway.<ref>[http://waderllc.com/2284-2287.pdf Recent Developments in Salinity Gradient Power]</ref> Statkraft has built the world's first [[Statkraft_osmotic_power_prototype_in_Hurum|prototype PRO power plant]] on the Oslo fjord which was opened by [[Mette-Marit, Crown Princess of Norway|Princess Mette-Marit of Norway]]<ref>[http://www.gizmag.com/statkraft-osmotic-power/13451/] Statkraft-osmotic-power</ref> on November 24, 2009. It aims to produce enough electricity to light and heat a small town within five years by osmosis. At first it will produce a minuscule 4 kilowatts – enough to heat a large electric kettle, but by 2015 the target is 25 megawatts – the same as a small wind farm.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8377186.stm BBC News Norway's Statkraft opens first osmotic power plant]</ref> In january 2014 however Statkraft announced not to continue this pilot. <ref>[http://www.forwardosmosistech.com/statkraft-discontinues-investments-in-pressure-retarded-osmosis/]</ref>

===Reversed electrodialysis===
A second method being developed and studied is [[reversed electrodialysis]] or reverse dialysis, which is essentially the creation of a salt battery. This method was described by Weinstein and Leitz as “an array of alternating anion and cation exchange membranes can be used to generate electric power from the free energy of river and sea water.”

The technology related to this type of power is still in its infant stages, even though the principle was discovered in the 1950s. Standards and a complete understanding of all the ways salinity gradients can be utilized are important goals to strive for in order make this clean energy source more viable in the future.

===Capacitive method===
A third method is [[Doriano Brogioli]]'s<ref name=""Brogioli"" /> capacitive method, which is relatively new and has so far only been tested on lab scale. With this method energy can be extracted out of the mixing of saline water and freshwater by cyclically charging up [[electrode]]s in contact with saline water, followed by a discharge in freshwater. Since the amount of electrical energy which is needed during the charging step is less than one gets out during the discharge step, each completed cycle effectively produces energy. An intuitive explanation of this effect is that the great number of [[ion]]s in the saline water efficiently neutralizes the charge on each electrode by forming a thin layer of opposite charge very close to the electrode surface, known as an [[double layer (interfacial)|electric double layer]]. Therefore, the [[voltage]] over the electrodes remains low during the charge step and charging is relatively easy. In between the charge and discharge step, the electrodes are brought in contact with freshwater. After this, there are less ions available to neutralize the charge on each electrode such that the voltage over the electrodes increases. The discharge step which follows is therefore able to deliver a relatively high amount of energy. A physical explanation is that on an electrically charged capacitor, there is a mutually attractive [[electric force]] between the [[electric charge]] on the electrode, and the ionic charge in the liquid. In order to pull ions away from the charged electrode, osmotic pressure must do [[work (physics)|work]]. This work done increases the electrical potential energy in the capacitor. An electronic explanation is that [[capacitance]] is a function of ion density. By introducing a salinity gradient and allowing some of the ions to diffuse out of the capacitor, this reduces the capacitance, and so the voltage must increase, since the voltage equals the ratio of charge to capacitance.

===Vapor pressure differences: open cycle and absorption refrigeration cycle (closed cycle)===
Both of these methods do not rely on membranes, so filtration requirements are not as important as they are in the PRO & RED schemes.

====Open cycle====
Similar to the open cycle in ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC). The disadvantage of this cycle is the cumbersome problem of a large diameter turbine (75 meters +) operating at below atmospheric pressure to extract the power between the water with less salinity & the water with greater salinity.

====Absorption refrigeration cycle (closed cycle)====
For the purpose of dehumidifying air, in a [[absorption refrigerator#Water spray absorption refrigeration|water-spray absorption refrigeration]] system, water vapor is dissolved into a [[deliquescent]] salt water mixture using osmotic power as an intermediary. The primary power source originates from a thermal difference, as part of a [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] [[heat engine]] cycle.

===Solar pond===
At the Eddy Potash Mine in New Mexico, a technology called ""salinity gradient [[solar pond]]"" (SGSP) is being utilized to provide the energy needed by the mine. '''This method does not harness osmotic power''', only solar power (see: [[solar pond]]). Sunlight reaching the bottom of the saltwater pond is absorbed as heat. The effect of [[natural convection]], wherein ""heat rises"", is blocked using density differences between the three layers that make up the pond, in order to trap heat. The upper convection zone is the uppermost zone, followed by the stable gradient zone, then the bottom thermal zone. The stable gradient zone is the most important. The saltwater in this layer can not rise to the higher zone because the saltwater above has lower salinity and is therefore less-dense and more buoyant; and it can not sink to the lower level because that saltwater is denser. This middle zone, the stable gradient zone, effectively becomes an ""insulator"" for the bottom layer (although the main purpose is to block natural convection, since water is a poor insulator). This water from the lower layer, the storage zone, is pumped out and the heat is used to produce energy, usually by turbine in an [[organic Rankine cycle]].<ref>[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/756432-k7Q3X9/webviewable/756432.pdf Salinity Gradient Solar Pond Technology Applied to Potash Solution Mining]</ref>

In theory a solar pond ''could'' be used to generate osmotic power if evaporation from solar heat is used to create a salinity gradient, ''and'' the potential energy in this salinity gradient is ''harnessed directly'' using one of the first three methods above, such as the capacitive method.

===Boron nitride nanotubes===

A research team built an experimental system using boron nitride that produced much greater power than the Statoil prototype. It used an impermeable and electrically insulating membrane that was pierced by a single boron nitride nanotube with an external diameter of a few dozen nanometers. With this membrane separating a salt water reservoir and a fresh water reservoir, the team measured the electric current passing through the membrane using two electrodes immersed in the fluid either side of the nanotube.

The results showed the device was able to generate an electric current on the order of a nanoampere. The researchers claim this is 1,000 times the yield of other known techniques for harvesting osmotic energy and makes boron nitride nanotubes an extremely efficient solution for harvesting the energy of salinity gradients for usable electrical power.

The team claimed that a {{convert|1|m2}} membrane could generate around 4&nbsp;kW and be capable of generating up to 30 MWh per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/osmotic-salinity-gradient-power-nanotubes/26623/ |title=Nanotubes boost potential of salinity power as a renewable energy source |publisher=Gizmag.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-15}}</ref>
===Using low caloric waste energy by regenerate a high solution ammonium bicarbonate in a solution with a low salinity===
At Pennsylvania State University, Dr. Logan tries to use waste heat with low calority using the fact that [[ammonium bicarbonate]] disappears into NH<sub>3</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> in warm water to form ammonia bicarbonate again in cold water. So in a RED energy producing closed system the two different gradients of salinity are kept.<ref>http://sites.psu.edu/energyfromwater/</ref>

==Possible negative environmental impact==

Marine and river environments have obvious differences in water quality, namely salinity. Each species of aquatic plant and animal is adapted to survive in either marine, brackish, or freshwater environments. There are species that can tolerate both, but these species usually thrive best in a specific water environment. The main waste product of salinity gradient technology is brackish water. The discharge of brackish water into the surrounding waters, if done in large quantities and with any regularity, will cause salinity fluctuations. While some variation in salinity is usual, particularly where fresh water (rivers) empties into an ocean or sea anyway, these variations become less important for both bodies of water with the addition of brackish waste waters. Extreme salinity changes in an aquatic environment may result in findings of low densities of both animals and plants due to intolerance of sudden severe salinity drops or spikes.<ref name=Montague>Montague, C., Ley, J. A Possible Effect of Salinity Fluctuation on Abundance of Benthic Vegetation and Associated Fauna in Northeastern Florida Bay. Estuaries and Coasts. 1993. Springer New York. Vol.15 No. 4. Pg. 703-717</ref> According to the prevailing environmentalist opinions, the possibility of these negative effects should be considered by the operators of future large blue energy establishments.

The impact of brackish water on ecosystems can be minimized by pumping it out to sea and releasing it into the mid-layer, away from the surface and bottom ecosystems.

Impingement and entrainment at intake structures are a concern due to large volumes of both river and sea water utilized in both PRO and RED schemes. Intake construction permits must meet strict environmental regulations and desalination plants and power plants that utilize surface water are sometimes involved with various local, state and federal agencies to obtain permission that can take upwards to 18 months.","==See also==

22391303,2017-05-16 17:15:00-05,Liquid nitrogen engine,"A '''liquid nitrogen vehicle''' is powered by [[liquid nitrogen]], which is stored in a tank. Traditional nitrogen engine designs work by heating the liquid nitrogen in a [[heat exchanger]], extracting heat from the ambient air and using the resulting pressurized gas to operate a piston or rotary motor. Vehicles propelled by liquid nitrogen have been demonstrated, but are not used commercially. One such vehicle, ''[[Liquid Air]]'' was demonstrated in 1902.

Liquid nitrogen propulsion may also be incorporated in hybrid systems, e.g., [[battery electric propulsion]] and fuel tanks to recharge the batteries. This kind of system is called a hybrid liquid nitrogen-electric propulsion. Additionally, [[regenerative braking]] can also be used in conjunction with this system.

In June 2016 trials will begin in London, UK on supermarket J Sainsbury's fleet of food delivery vehicles:  using a Dearman nitrogen engine to provide power for the cooling of food cargo when the vehicle is stationary and the main engine is off. Currently delivery lorries mostly have 2nd smaller diesel engines to power cooling when the main engine is off.<ref>{{cite web|title = Sainsbury's trials Dearman's world-leading cooling technology|publisher = Innovate UK|url = https://www.gov.uk/government/news/sainsburys-trials-dearmans-world-leading-cooling-technology}}</ref>

==Description==
Liquid nitrogen is generated by [[Cryocooler|cryogenic]] or reversed [[Stirling engine]] <ref>{{cite book |url= http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/engineering/9780123749963/chapter-14dot-vapor-and-gas-refrigeration-cycles/toc210 |title= Modern Engineering Thermodynamics |first= Robert T. |last= Balmer |publisher= Academic Press |chapter= 14.15 Reversed Stirling Cycle Refrigeration |isbn= 978-0-12-374996-3 }}</ref><ref>[http://stirlingultracold.com/history history of refrigeration with Stirling engines]</ref><ref>[http://www.stirlingcryogenics.com/home/] Comercial Sterling engine cooling</ref> coolers that liquefy the main component of air, [[nitrogen]] (N<sub>2</sub>).  The cooler can be powered by electricity or through direct mechanical work from [[Hydroelectricity|hydro]] or
[[wind turbine]]s. 
Liquid nitrogen is distributed and stored in [[Vacuum flask|insulated containers]].  The insulation reduces heat flow into the stored nitrogen; this is necessary because heat from the surrounding environment boils the liquid, which then transitions to a gaseous state.  Reducing inflowing heat reduces the loss of liquid nitrogen in storage.  The requirements of storage prevent the use of pipelines as a means of transport.  Since long-distance pipelines would be costly due to the insulation requirements, it would be costly to use distant energy sources for production of liquid nitrogen.  Petroleum reserves are typically a vast distance from consumption but can be transferred at ambient temperatures.

Liquid nitrogen consumption is in essence production in reverse.  The [[Stirling engine]] or cryogenic heat engine offers a way to power vehicles and a means to generate electricity.  Liquid nitrogen can also serve as a direct coolant for [[refrigerators]], [[CPU cooling|electrical equipment]] and  [[air conditioning]] units.  The consumption of liquid nitrogen is in effect boiling and returning the [[nitrogen]] to the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]].  <!-- discuss elevated pollution to produce and transport the gigatonnes of the stuff in the first place -->

In the [[Dearman Engine]] the nitrogen is heated by combining it with the heat exchange fluid inside the cylinder of the engine.<ref name=""T&T"">{{Cite journal |title=Mullistava idea: Tulevaisuuden auto voi kulkea typpimoottorilla |author=Raili Leino |date=2012-10-22 |journal=Tekniikka&Talous |url=http://www.tekniikkatalous.fi/autot/mullistava+idea+tulevaisuuden+auto+voi+kulkea+typpimoottorilla/a849225 |language=Finnish}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=The Technology |publisher=Dearman Engine Company |year=2012 |url=http://www.dearmanengine.com/cms/the-technology/ }}</ref><!-- This primary source provides the same information as the Finnish language reliable source. -->

==Criticisms==

=== Cost of production ===

Liquid nitrogen production is an energy-intensive process. Currently practical refrigeration plants producing a few tons/day of liquid nitrogen operate at about 50% of [[Carnot heat engine|Carnot efficiency]].<ref>J. Franz, C. A. Ordonez, A. Carlos, ''Cryogenic Heat Engines Made Using Electrocaloric Capacitors'', American Physical Society, Texas Section Fall Meeting, October 4–6, 2001 Fort Worth, Texas Meeting ID: TSF01, abstract #EC.009, 10/2001. {{bibcode|2001APS..TSF.EC009F}}</ref> Currently surplus liquid nitrogen is produced as a byproduct in the production of [[liquid oxygen]].<ref name=""T&T"" />

===Energy density of liquid nitrogen===
Any process that relies on a phase-change of a substance will have much lower [[energy density|energy densities]] than processes involving a chemical reaction in a substance, which in turn have lower energy densities than nuclear reactions.  Liquid nitrogen as an energy store has a low energy density. Liquid hydrocarbon fuels, by comparison, have a high energy density. A high energy density makes the logistics of transport and storage more convenient. Convenience is an important factor in consumer acceptance. The convenient storage of petroleum fuels combined with its low cost has led to an unrivaled success. In addition, a petroleum fuel is a [[primary energy source]], not just an energy storage and transport medium.

The energy density — derived from nitrogen's isobaric heat of vaporization and specific heat in gaseous state — that can be realised from liquid nitrogen at atmospheric pressure and zero degrees Celsius ambient temperature is about 97 watt-hours per kilogram (W·h/kg).   This compares with 100-250 W·h/kg for a [[lithium-ion battery]] and 3,000 W·h/kg for a gasoline [[Internal combustion engine|combustion engine]] running at 28% thermal efficiency, 30 times the density of liquid nitrogen used at the Carnot efficiency.<ref name=""Knowlen"">C. Knowlen, A.T. Mattick, A.P. Bruckner and A. Hertzberg, [http://wayback.archive.org/web/*/http://www.aa.washington.edu/AERP/cryocar/Papers/sae98.pdf ""High Efficiency Conversion Systems for Liquid Nitrogen Automobiles""], Society of Automotive Engineers Inc, 1988.</ref>

For an isothermal expansion engine to have a range comparable to an internal combustion engine, a {{convert|350|l|USgal|0|adj=on}} insulated onboard storage vessel is required.<ref name=""Knowlen"" /> A practical volume, but a noticeable increase over the typical {{convert|50|l|USgal|0|adj=on}} gasoline tank. The addition of more complex power cycles would reduce this requirement and help enable frost free operation. However, no commercially practical instances of liquid nitrogen use for vehicle propulsion exist.

===Frost formation===
Unlike internal combustion engines, using a cryogenic working fluid requires heat exchangers to warm and cool the working fluid. In a humid environment, frost formation will prevent heat flow and thus represents an engineering challenge. To prevent frost build up, multiple working fluids can be used. This adds topping cycles to ensure the heat exchanger does not fall below freezing.  Additional heat exchangers, weight, complexity, efficiency loss, and expense, would be required to enable frost free operation.<ref name=""Knowlen"" />

===Safety===
However efficient the insulation on the nitrogen fuel tank, there will inevitably be losses by evaporation to the atmosphere. If a vehicle is stored in a poorly ventilated space, there is some risk that leaking nitrogen could reduce the oxygen concentration in the air and cause [[asphyxiation]]. Since nitrogen is a colorless and odourless gas that already makes up 78% of air, such a change would be difficult to detect.

Cryogenic liquids are hazardous if spilled. Liquid nitrogen can cause [[frostbite]] and can make some materials extremely brittle.

As liquid N2 is colder than 90.2K, oxygen from the atmosphere can condense. Liquid oxygen can spontaneously and violently react with organic chemicals, including petroleum products like asphalt.<ref>Werley, Barry L. (Edtr.) (1991). ""Fire Hazards in Oxygen Systems"". ASTM Technical Professional training. Philadelphia: ASTM International Subcommittee G-4.05.</ref>

Since the liquid to gas [[expansion ratio]] of this substance is 1:694, a tremendous amount of force can be generated if liquid nitrogen is rapidly vaporized. In an incident in 2006 at [[Texas A&M University]], the pressure-relief devices of a tank of liquid nitrogen were sealed with brass plugs. As a result, the tank failed catastrophically, and exploded.<ref>{{cite web|title = Investigative Report on Chemistry 301A Cylinder Explosion|author = Brent S. Mattox|publisher = Texas A&M University|format = reprint|url = http://ucih.ucdavis.edu/docs/chemistry_301a.pdf}}</ref>

=== Tanks ===
The tanks must be designed{{Who|date=October 2012}} to safety standards appropriate for a [[pressure vessel]], such as [[ISO 11439]].<ref>[http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=33298 Gas cylinders -- High pressure cylinders for the on-board storage of natural gas as a fuel for automotive vehicles]</ref>

The storage tank may be made of:
* [[steel]]
* [[aluminium]]
* [[carbon fiber]]
* [[Kevlar]]
* other materials, or combinations of the above.

The fiber materials are considerably lighter than metals but generally more expensive. Metal tanks can withstand a large number of pressure cycles, but must be checked for corrosion periodically. Liquid nitrogen, LN2, is commonly transported in insulated tanks, up to 50 litres, at atmospheric pressure. These tanks, being non-pressurized tanks, are not subject to inspection. Very large tanks for LN2 are sometimes pressurized to less than 25 psi to aid in transferring the liquid at point of use.

=== Emission output ===
Like other non-combustion energy storage technologies, a liquid nitrogen vehicle displaces the emission source from the vehicle's tail pipe to the central electrical generating plant. Where emissions-free sources are available, net production of pollutants can be reduced. Emission control measures at a central generating plant may be more effective and less costly than treating the emissions of widely dispersed vehicles.

== Advantages ==
Liquid nitrogen vehicles are comparable in many ways to [[electric vehicle]]s, but use liquid nitrogen to store the energy instead of batteries. Their potential advantages over other vehicles include:

* Much like electrical vehicles, liquid nitrogen vehicles would ultimately be powered through the electrical grid, which makes it easier to focus on reducing pollution from one source, as opposed to the millions of vehicles on the road.
* Transportation of the fuel would not be required due to drawing power off the electrical grid. This presents significant cost benefits. Pollution created during fuel transportation would be eliminated.
* Lower maintenance costs
* Liquid nitrogen tanks can be disposed of or recycled with less pollution than batteries.
* Liquid nitrogen vehicles are unconstrained by the degradation problems associated with current battery systems.
* The tank may be able to be refilled more often and in less time than batteries can be recharged, with re-fueling rates comparable to liquid fuels.
* It can work as part of a [[combined cycle]] powertrain in conjunction with a petrol or diesel engine, using the waste heat from one to run the other in a [[turbocompound]] system. It can even run as a hybrid system.

== Disadvantages ==
The principal disadvantage is the inefficient use of primary energy. Energy is used to liquefy nitrogen, which in turn provides the energy to run the motor. Any conversion of energy has losses. For liquid nitrogen cars, electrical energy is lost during the liquefication process of nitrogen.

Liquid nitrogen is not available in public refueling stations; however, there are distribution systems in place at most welding gas suppliers and liquid nitrogen is an abundant by-product of liquid oxygen production.

== Other Uses ==
In 2008, the US Patent Office granted a patent on a liquid nitrogen powered turbine engine.<ref>{{Citation|last=Reyes|first=De Reyes, Edward|title=Liquid nitrogen engine|date=25 Jun 2013|url=http://www.google.ch/patents/US8468829|accessdate=2016-11-18}}</ref> The turbine flash-expands liquid nitrogen that is sprayed into the high-pressure section of the turbine, and the expanding gas is combined with incoming pressurized air to produce a high-velocity stream of gas that is ejected from the back of the turbine. The resulting gas stream can be used to drive generators or other devices. The system has not been demonstrated to power electric generators of greater than 1&nbsp;kW,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nitroturbodyne.com/ln2-turbine/|title=LN2 Turbine - Clean, Green Energy|website=www.nitroturbodyne.com|access-date=2016-11-18}}</ref> however higher output may possible.","== See also ==

*'''Power generation'''
: By 2040, renewable energy is projected to equal coal and natural gas electricity generation. Several jurisdictions, including Denmark, Germany, the state of South Australia and some US states have achieved high integration of variable renewables. For example, in 2015 wind power met 42% of electricity demand in Denmark, 23.2% in Portugal and 15.5% in Uruguay. Interconnectors enable countries to balance electricity systems by allowing the import and export of renewable energy. Innovative hybrid systems have emerged between countries and regions.<ref>{{cite web|last1=REN21|title=Renewables 2016: Global Status Report|url=http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_Full_Report.pdf|website=Renewable Energy Policy Network|accessdate=2016-10-31}}</ref>

*'''Heating'''
: [[Solar water heating]] makes an important contribution to [[renewable heat]] in many countries, most notably in China, which now has 70% of the global total (180 GWth). Most of these systems are installed on multi-family apartment buildings and meet a portion of the hot water needs of an estimated 50–60 million households in China. Worldwide, total installed [[solar water heating]] systems meet a portion of the water heating needs of over 70 million households. The use of biomass for heating continues to grow as well. In Sweden, national use of biomass energy has surpassed that of oil. Direct geothermal for heating is also growing rapidly.<ref name=ren53>REN21 (2010).

*'''Transportation'''
[[Image:Soybeanbus.jpg|thumb|A bus fueled by [[biodiesel]]]]

:[[Bioethanol]] is an [[alcohol]] made by [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]], mostly from [[carbohydrate]]s produced in [[sugar]] or [[starch]] crops such as [[Maize|corn]], [[sugarcane]], or [[sweet sorghum]]. [[cellulose|Cellulosic biomass]], derived from non-food sources such as trees and grasses is also being developed as a [[feedstock]] for ethanol production. Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a [[gasoline]] [[Fuel additive|additive]] to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the [[Biofuel in the United States|USA]] and in [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Brazil]]. [[Biodiesel]] can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a [[diesel fuel|diesel]] additive to reduce levels of particulates, [[carbon monoxide]], and [[hydrocarbon]]s from diesel-powered vehicles. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is the most common [[biofuel]] in Europe.

:A [[solar vehicle]] is an [[electric vehicle]] powered completely or significantly by direct [[solar energy]]. Usually, [[photovoltaic]] (PV) cells contained in [[solar panel]]s convert the [[sun]]'s energy directly into [[electric energy]]. The term ""solar vehicle"" usually implies that solar energy is used to power all or part of a vehicle's [[Vehicle propulsion|propulsion]]. [[Solar power]] may be also used to provide power for communications or controls or other auxiliary functions. Solar vehicles are not sold as practical day-to-day transportation devices at present, but are primarily demonstration vehicles and engineering exercises, often sponsored by government agencies. However, indirectly solar-charged vehicles are widespread and [[Electric boat|solar boats]] are available commercially.

== History ==

Prior to the development of coal in the mid 19th century, nearly all energy used was renewable. Almost without a doubt the oldest known use of renewable energy, in the form of traditional biomass to fuel fires, dates from 790,000 years ago. Use of biomass for fire did not become commonplace until many hundreds of thousands of years later, sometime between 200,000 and 400,000 years ago.<ref name=Fire>{{cite web|title=The Discovery of Fire|url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/ancientdailylife/qt/fire_control.htm|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=15 January 2013|author=K. Kris Hirst}}</ref> Probably the second oldest usage of renewable energy is harnessing the wind in order to drive ships over water. This practice can be traced back some 7000 years, to ships on the Nile.<ref>{{cite web|title=wind energy|work=[[The Encyclopedia of Alternative Energy and Sustainable Living]]|url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/W/AE_wind_energy.html|accessdate=15 January 2013}}</ref> Moving into the time of recorded history, the primary sources of traditional renewable energy were human [[Manual labour|labor]], [[animal power]], [[water power]], wind, in grain crushing [[windmill]]s, and [[firewood]], a traditional biomass. A graph of energy use in the United States up until 1900 shows oil and natural gas with about the same importance in 1900 as wind and solar played in 2010.

In the 1860s and '70s there were already fears that civilization would run out of fossil fuels and the need was felt for a better source. In 1873 Professor [[Augustine Mouchot]] wrote:
<blockquote>
The time will arrive when the industry of Europe will cease to find those natural resources, so necessary for it. Petroleum springs and coal mines are not inexhaustible but are rapidly diminishing in many places.  Will man, then, return to the power of water and wind? Or will he emigrate where the most powerful source of heat sends its rays to all?  History will show what will come.<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224235659/http://sustainablehistory.wordpress.com/2011/03/29/the-surprising-history-of-sustainable-energy/|archivedate=24 December 2014|deadurl=no|url=https://sustainablehistory.wordpress.com/2011/03/29/the-surprising-history-of-sustainable-energy|title=The surprising history of sustainable energy |publisher=Sustainablehistory.wordpress.com |accessdate=1 November 2012}}</ref>
</blockquote>
In 1885, [[Werner von Siemens]], commenting on the discovery of the [[photovoltaic effect]] in the solid state, wrote:
<blockquote>
In conclusion, I would say that however great the scientific importance of this discovery may be, its practical value will be no less obvious when we reflect that the supply of solar energy is both without limit and without cost, and that it will continue to pour down upon us for countless ages after all the coal deposits of the earth have been exhausted and forgotten.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Werner von Siemens|title=On the electromotive action of illuminated selenium, discovered by Mr. Fritts, of New York|journal=Van Nostrands Engineering Magazine|date=1885|volume=32|pages=514–516}}</ref>
</blockquote>
[[Max Weber]] mentioned the end of fossil fuel in the concluding paragraphs of his [[Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus]], published in 1905.<ref>Weber suggests that the modern economic world will determine the lifestyle of everyone born into it ""until the last [[hundredweight]] of fossil fuel is burned"" (''[http://www.zeno.org/Soziologie/M/Weber,+Max/Schriften+zur+Religionssoziologie/Die+protestantische+Ethik+und+der+Geist+des+Kapitalismus/II.+Die+Berufsethik+des+asketischen+Protestantismus/2.+Askese+und+kapitalistischer+Geist bis der letzte Zentner fossilen Brennstoffs verglüht ist]'').</ref>

Development of solar engines continued until the outbreak of World War I. The importance of solar energy was recognized in a 1911 ''[[Scientific American]]'' article: ""in the far distant future, [[Fossil fuel|natural fuel]]s having been exhausted [solar power] will remain as the only means of existence of the human race"".<ref>[http://www.hbs.edu/research/pdf/12-105.pdf ""Power from Sunshine"": A Business History of Solar Energy] 25 May 2012</ref>

=== Wind power ===
{{Main article|Wind power}}
[[File:Shepherds Flat Wind Farm 2011.jpg|thumb|The 845{{nbsp}}MW [[Shepherds Flat Wind Farm]] near [[Arlington, Oregon]], USA]]

Airflows can be used to run [[wind turbine]]s. Modern utility-scale wind turbines range from around 600&nbsp;kW to 5 MW of rated power, although turbines with rated output of 1.5–3 MW have become the most common for commercial use. The largest generator capacity of a single installed onshore wind turbine reached 7.5 MW in 2015. The power available from the wind is a function of the cube of the wind speed, so as wind speed increases, power output increases up to the maximum output for the particular turbine.<ref name=""EWEA"">{{cite web | title = Analysis of Wind Energy in the EU-25 | publisher = European Wind Energy Association | url = http://www.ewea.org/fileadmin/ewea_documents/documents/publications/WETF/Facts_Summary.pdf |format= PDF | accessdate = 11 March 2007}}</ref> Areas where winds are stronger and more constant, such as offshore and high [[altitude]] sites, are preferred locations for wind farms. Typically [[Capacity factor|full load hour]]s of wind turbines vary between 16 and 57 percent annually, but might be higher in particularly favorable offshore sites.<ref>[[Martin Kaltschmitt]], Wolfgang Streicher, Andreas Wiese (eds.): ''Erneuerbare Energien. Systemtechnik, Wirtschaftlichkeit, Umweltaspekte''. Springer, Berlin/Heidelberg 2013, p. 819.</ref>

Wind-generated electricity met nearly 4% of global electricity demand in 2015, with nearly 63 GW of new wind power capacity installed. Wind energy was the leading source of new capacity in Europe, the US and Canada, and the second largest in China. In Denmark, wind energy met more than 40% of its electricity demand while Ireland, Portugal and Spain each met nearly 20%.

Globally, the long-term technical potential of wind energy is believed to be five times total current global energy production, or 40 times current electricity demand, assuming all practical barriers needed were overcome. This would require wind turbines to be installed over large areas, particularly in areas of higher wind resources, such as offshore. As offshore wind speeds average ~90% greater than that of land, so offshore resources can contribute substantially more energy than land stationed turbines.<ref>""<cite>Offshore stations experience mean wind speeds at 80 m that are 90% greater than over land on average.</cite> [http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/winds/global_winds.html Evaluation of global wind power]<br />""<cite>Overall, the researchers calculated winds at 80 meters [300 feet] above [[sea level]] traveled over the ocean at approximately 8.6 meters per second and at nearly 4.5 meters per second over land [20 and 10 miles per hour, respectively].</cite>"" [http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/may2005/2005-05-17-09.asp#anchor6 Global Wind Map Shows Best Wind Farm Locations] .

=== Hydropower ===
{{Main article|Hydroelectricity|Hydropower|}}
[[File:ThreeGorgesDam-China2009.jpg|thumb|The [[Three Gorges Dam]] on the [[Yangtze River]] in China]]

In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the worlds total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity.<ref>http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_Full_Report_REN21.pdf</ref> Since water is about 800 times [[Density of air|denser than air]], even a slow flowing stream of water, or moderate sea [[Swell (ocean)|swell]], can yield considerable amounts of energy. There are many forms of water energy:
* Historically hydroelectric power came from constructing large hydroelectric dams and reservoirs, which are still popular in third world countries. The largest of which is the [[Three Gorges Dam]](2003) in [[China]] and the [[Itaipu Dam]](1984) built by Brazil and Paraguay.
* [[Small hydro]] systems are hydroelectric power installations that typically produce up to {{nowrap|50 MW}} of power. They are often used on small rivers or as a low impact development on larger rivers. China is the largest producer of hydroelectricity in the world and has more than 45,000 small hydro installations.<ref>https://www.irena.org/DocumentDownloads/Publications/RE_Technologies_Cost_Analysis-HYDROPOWER.pdf</ref>
* [[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity]] plants derive [[kinetic energy]] from rivers without the creation of a large [[reservoir]]. This style of generation may still produce a large amount of electricity, such as the [[Chief Joseph Dam]] on the Columbia river in the United States.

Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. For countries having the [[List of countries by electricity production from renewable sources|largest percentage]] of electricity from renewables, the top 50 are primarily hydroelectric. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010, representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use. There are now three hydroelectricity stations larger than 10 GW: the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China, [[Itaipu Dam]] across the Brazil/Paraguay border, and [[Guri Dam]] in Venezuela.<ref name=wi2012>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/9527 |title=Use and Capacity of Global Hydropower Increases |author=Worldwatch Institute |date=January 2012 |work= }}</ref>

[[Wave power]], which captures the energy of ocean surface waves, and [[tidal power]], converting the energy of tides, are two forms of hydropower with future potential; however, they are not yet widely employed commercially. A demonstration project operated by the [[Ocean Renewable Power Company]] on the coast of [[Maine]], and connected to the grid, harnesses tidal power from the [[Bay of Fundy]], location of world's highest tidal flow. [[Ocean thermal energy conversion]], which uses the temperature difference between cooler deep and warmer surface waters, has currently no economic feasibility.

[[Solar energy]], radiant [[light]] and [[heat]] from the [[sun]], is harnessed using a range of ever-evolving technologies such as [[solar heating]], [[photovoltaics]], [[concentrated solar power]] (CSP), [[concentrator photovoltaics]] (CPV), [[solar architecture]] and [[artificial photosynthesis]].<ref name=ie11/><ref>{{cite web|title=Solar Fuels and Artificial Photosynthesis|work=Royal Society of Chemistry |year=2012 |url=http://www.rsc.org/ScienceAndTechnology/Policy/Documents/solar-fuels.asp|accessdate= 11 March 2013}}</ref> Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either [[passive solar]] or [[active solar]] depending on the way they capture, convert and distribute solar energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable [[thermal mass]] or light dispersing properties, and designing spaces that [[Ventilation (architecture)|naturally circulate air]]. Active solar technologies encompass [[solar thermal energy]], using [[Solar thermal collector|solar collectors]] for heating, and [[solar power]], converting [[sunlight]] into [[electricity]] either directly using [[photovoltaics]] (PV), or indirectly using [[concentrated solar power]] (CSP).

[[File:NesjavellirPowerPlant edit2.jpg|thumb|Steam rising from the [[Nesjavellir Geothermal Power Station]] in Iceland]]

High Temperature Geothermal energy is from [[thermal energy]] generated and stored in the Earth. Thermal energy is the energy that determines the [[temperature]] of matter. Earth's geothermal energy originates from the original formation of the planet and from [[radioactive decay]] of minerals (in currently uncertain<ref name=Dye>{{cite journal | last1 = Dye | first1 = S.

The [[geothermal gradient]], which is the difference in temperature between the core of the planet and its surface, drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of [[heat]] from the core to the surface. The adjective ''geothermal'' originates from the Greek roots ''geo'', meaning earth, and ''thermos'', meaning heat.

The heat that is used for geothermal energy can be from deep within the Earth, all the way down to Earth's core&nbsp;– {{convert|4,000|mi}} down. At the core, temperatures may reach over 9,000&nbsp;°F (5,000&nbsp;°C). Heat conducts from the core to surrounding rock. Extremely high temperature and pressure cause some rock to melt, which is commonly known as magma. Magma convects upward since it is lighter than the solid rock. This magma then heats rock and water in the crust, sometimes up to {{convert|700|F}}.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nemzer |first=J |title=Geothermal heating and cooling |url=http://www.geothermal.marin.org/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980111021839/http://geothermal.marin.org/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1998-01-11 }}</ref>

From [[hot spring]]s, geothermal energy has been used for bathing since [[Paleolithic]] times and for space heating since ancient Roman times, but it is now better known for [[electricity generation]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://faculty.fairfield.edu/mediacenter/nm_webdesign/s_zandan/sz_alt_energy/geothermal_energy.html|title=Project 2 template|website=faculty.fairfield.edu|access-date=2017-01-17}}</ref>

Low Temperature Geothermal<ref name=""energy.gov""/> refers to the use of the outer crust of the earth as a [[Thermal Battery]] to facilitate [[Renewable thermal energy]] for heating and cooling buildings, and other refrigeration and industrial uses.  In this form of Geothermal, a [[Geothermal heat pump|Geothermal Heat Pump]] and [[Ground-coupled heat exchanger]] are used together to move heat energy into the earth (for cooling) and out of the earth (for heating) on a varying seasonal basis.  Low temperature Geothermal (generally referred to as ""GHP"") is an increasingly important renewable technology because it both reduces total annual energy loads associated with heating and cooling, and it also flattens the electric demand curve eliminating the extreme summer and winter peak electric supply requirements.  Thus Low Temperature Geothermal/GHP is becoming an increasing national priority with multiple tax credit support<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsireusa.org/|title=Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency® - DSIRE|website=DSIRE}}</ref> and focus as part of the ongoing movement toward Net Zero Energy.<ref>[[Zero-energy building]]</ref><ref name=""Net Zero Foundation""/>  New York City has even just passed a law<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ny-geo.org/blogs/a-word-from-us/81515204-new-york-city-council-gives-a-thumbs-up-to-geothermal-heat-pumps|title=New York City Gives a Thumbs Up to Geothermal Heat Pumps|website=ny-geo.org}}</ref> to require GHP anytime is shown to be economical with 20 year financing including the Socialized Cost of Carbon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/EPAactivities/economics/scc.html|title=Page being updated.|first=US|last=EPA,OEI|website=www3.epa.gov}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/right-price-for-carbon/|title=What Is the Right Price for Carbon?|first=Evan Lehmann,|last=Climatewire|publisher=}}</ref>

The latter crop is particularly suitable for growing in dryland conditions, and is being investigated by [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] for its potential to provide fuel, along with food and animal feed, in arid parts of Asia and Africa.<ref>[http://resourcespace.icrisat.ac.in/filestore/8/4/0_6c06c9b61b19c20/840_be710da94740b90.pdf ''Sweet sorghum for food, feed and fuel''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904014010/http://resourcespace.icrisat.ac.in/filestore/8/4/0_6c06c9b61b19c20/840_be710da94740b90.pdf |date=4 September 2015 }} New Agriculturalist, January 2008.</ref>

With advanced technology being developed, cellulosic biomass, such as trees and grasses, are also used as feedstocks for ethanol production. Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a [[gasoline]] additive to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the [[Ethanol fuel in the United States|United States]] and in [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Brazil]]. The energy costs for producing bio-ethanol are almost equal to, the energy yields from bio-ethanol. However, according to the [[European Environment Agency]], biofuels do not address global warming concerns.<ref name=eea-biofuels>{{cite web|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/about-us/governance/scientific-committee/sc-opinions/opinions-on-scientific-issues/sc-opinion-on-greenhouse-gas |title=Opinion of the EEA Scientific Committee on Greenhouse Gas Accounting in Relation to Bioenergy |accessdate=1 November 2012}}</ref> Biodiesel is made from [[vegetable oil]]s, [[animal fat]]s or recycled greases. It can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, or more commonly as a diesel additive to reduce levels of particulates, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons from diesel-powered vehicles. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is the most common biofuel in Europe. Biofuels provided 2.7% of the world's transport fuel in 2010.<ref name=ren212011>{{cite web|url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/GSR2011_Master18.pdf |title=Renewables 2011: Global Status Report |author=[[REN21]] |year=2011 |pages=13–14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513045354/http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/GSR2011_Master18.pdf |archivedate=13 May 2012 }}</ref>

Biomass, biogas and biofuels are burned to produce heat/power and in doing so harm the environment.

===Energy storage===
{{main article|Energy storage|Grid energy storage}}
Energy storage is a collection of methods used to [[energy storage|store electrical energy]] on an [[grid (electricity)|electrical power grid]], or off it. Electrical energy is stored during times when production (especially from intermittent power plants such as renewable electricity sources such as [[wind power]], [[tidal power]], [[solar power]]) exceeds consumption, and returned to the grid when production falls below consumption. [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] is used for more than 90% of all grid power storage.

From the end of 2004, worldwide renewable energy capacity grew at rates of 10–60% annually for many technologies. In 2015 global investment in renewables rose 5% to $285.9 billion, breaking the previous record of $278.5 billion in 2011. 2015 was also the first year that saw renewables, excluding large hydro, account for the majority of all new power capacity (134&nbsp;GW, making up 53.6% of the total). Of the renewables total, wind accounted for 72&nbsp;GW and solar photovoltaics 56&nbsp;GW; both record-breaking numbers and sharply up from 2014 figures (49&nbsp;GW and 45&nbsp;GW respectively). In financial terms, solar made up 56% of total new investment and wind accounted for 38%.

Projections vary. The EIA has predicted that almost two thirds of net additions to power capacity will come from renewables by 2020 due to the combined policy benefits of local pollution, decarbonisation and energy diversification. Some studies have set out roadmaps to power 100% of the world’s energy with wind, hydroelectric and solar by the year 2030.

According to a 2011 projection by the International Energy Agency, solar power generators may produce most of the world's electricity within 50 years, reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases that harm the environment. Cedric Philibert, senior analyst in the renewable energy division at the IEA said: ""Photovoltaic and solar-thermal plants may meet most of the world's demand for electricity by 2060{{spaced ndash}}and half of all energy needs{{spaced ndash}}with wind, hydropower and biomass plants supplying much of the remaining generation"". ""Photovoltaic and concentrated solar power together can become the major source of electricity"", Philibert said.<ref name=""Ben Sills""/>

Renewable energy technologies are getting cheaper, through technological change and through the benefits of mass production and market competition. A 2011 IEA report said: ""A portfolio of renewable energy technologies is becoming cost-competitive in an increasingly broad range of circumstances, in some cases providing investment opportunities without the need for specific economic support,"" and added that ""cost reductions in critical technologies, such as wind and solar, are set to continue.""<ref name=henning>{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/23/us-energy-iea-renewables-idUSTRE7AM0OV20111123 |title=Renewable energy becoming cost competitive, IEA says |author=Henning Gloystein |date=23 November 2011 |work=Reuters }}</ref>

Hydro-electricity and geothermal electricity produced at favourable sites are now the cheapest way to generate electricity. Renewable energy costs continue to drop, and the levelised cost of electricity ([[LCOE]]) is declining for wind power, solar photovoltaic ([[Photovoltaics|PV]]), concentrated solar power ([[Concentrated solar power|CSP]]) and some biomass technologies.<ref name=irena111>{{cite web |url=http://www.irena.org/DocumentDownloads/Publications/Overview_Renewable%20Power%20Generation%20Costs%20in%202012.pdf |title=Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2012: An Overview |author=International Renewable Energy Agency |year=2012 |work= }}</ref> Renewable energy is also the most economic solution for new grid-connected capacity in areas with good resources. As the cost of renewable power falls, the scope of economically viable applications increases. Renewable technologies are now often the most economic solution for new generating capacity. Where ""oil-fired generation is the predominant power generation source (e.g. on islands, off-grid and in some countries) a lower-cost renewable solution almost always exists today"".<ref name=irena111/> A series of studies by the US [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] modeled the ""grid in the Western US under a number of different scenarios where intermittent renewables accounted for 33 percent of the total power."" In the models, inefficiencies in cycling the fossil fuel plants to compensate for the variation in solar and wind energy resulted in an additional cost of ""between $0.47 and $1.28 to each MegaWatt hour generated""; however, the savings in the cost of the fuels saved ""adds up to $7 billion, meaning the added costs are, at most, two percent of the savings.""<ref name=ArsTechnica>

=== Hydroelectricity ===

Only a quarter of the worlds estimated hydroelectric potential of 14,000 TWh/year has been developed, the regional potentials for the growth of hydropower around the world are, 71% Europe, 75% North America, 79% South America, 95% Africa, 95% Middle East, 82% Asia Pacific. However, the political realities of new reservoirs in western countries, economic limitations in the third world and the lack of a transmission system in undeveloped areas, result in the possibility of developing 25% of the remaining potential before 2050, with the bulk of that being in the Asia Pacific area.<ref>http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/hydropower_essentials.pdf</ref> There is slow growth taking place in Western counties, but not in the conventional dam and reservoir style of the past. New projects take the form of [[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity|run-of-the-river]] and [[small hydro]], neither using large reservoirs. It is popular to repower old dams thereby increasing their efficiency and capacity as well as quicker responsiveness on the grid.<ref>https://www.ntnu.no/documents/381182060/641036380/Leif+Lia_FINAL.PDF/32bac8f3-b443-493b-a1eb-e22ce572acd9</ref> Where circumstances permit existing dams like the [[Richard B.

[[Photovoltaics]] (PV) uses [[solar cell]]s assembled into [[solar panel]]s to convert sunlight into electricity. It's a fast-growing technology doubling its worldwide installed capacity every couple of years. [[Photovoltaic system|PV systems]] range from small, residential and commercial [[Rooftop photovoltaic power station|rooftop]] or [[Building-integrated photovoltaics|building integrated]] installations, to large utility-scale [[photovoltaic power station]]. The predominant PV technology is [[crystalline silicon]], while [[thin-film solar cell]] technology accounts for about 10 percent of global photovoltaic deployment. In recent years, PV technology has improved its electricity generating [[Solar cell efficiency|efficiency]], reduced the installation [[price per watt|cost per watt]] as well as its [[crystalline silicon#Energy payback time|energy payback time]], and has reached [[grid parity]] in at least 30 different markets by 2014.<ref name=""deutsche-2015-chasm"">

Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s.   As the cost of solar electricity has fallen, the number of grid-connected [[solar PV systems]] has [[Growth of photovoltaics|grown into the millions]] and utility-scale [[Photovoltaic power station|solar power station]]s with hundreds of megawatts are being built. Solar PV is rapidly becoming an inexpensive, low-carbon technology to harness renewable energy from the Sun.

Many solar photovoltaic power stations have been built, mainly in Europe, China and the USA.<ref name=""PV"">Denis Lenardic.

Many of these plants are integrated with agriculture and some use tracking systems that follow the sun's daily path across the sky to generate more electricity than fixed-mounted systems. There are no fuel costs or emissions during operation of the power stations.

However, when it comes to renewable energy systems and PV, it is not just large systems that matter. [[Building-integrated photovoltaics]] or ""onsite"" PV systems use existing land and structures and generate power close to where it is consumed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jcwinnie.biz/wordpress/?p=1724 |title=Solar Integrated in New Jersey |publisher=Jcwinnie.biz |accessdate=20 August 2013}}</ref>

Recent technological advances have expanded the range and size of viable resources, especially for applications such as home heating, opening a potential for widespread exploitation. Geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels. As a result, geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate [[global warming]] if widely deployed in place of fossil fuels.

The [[International Geothermal Association]] (IGA) has reported that 10,715 MW of geothermal power in 24 countries is online, which is expected to generate 67,246 GWh of electricity in 2010.<ref name=gea2010/> This represents a 20% increase in geothermal power online capacity since 2005.

Renewable energy technology has sometimes been seen as a costly luxury item by critics, and affordable only in the affluent developed world. This erroneous view has persisted for many years, but 2015 was the first year when investment in non-hydro renewables, was higher in developing countries, with $156 billion invested, mainly in China, India, and Brazil.<ref>FS-UNEP Collaborating Centre, [http://fs-unep-centre.org/sites/default/files/publications/globaltrendsinrenewableenergyinvestment2016lowres_0.pdf Global trends in renewable energy investment], 2016 p. 14.</ref>

Renewable energy can be particularly suitable for developing countries. In rural and remote areas, transmission and distribution of energy generated from fossil fuels can be difficult and expensive. Producing renewable energy locally can offer a viable alternative.<ref name=aus>[http://www.ausaid.gov.au/publications/pdf/renewable_energy.pdf Power for the People] p. 3. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330120425/http://www.ausaid.gov.au/publications/pdf/renewable_energy.pdf |date=30 March 2012 }}</ref>

Technology advances are opening up a huge new market for solar power: the approximately 1.3 billion people around the world who don't have access to grid electricity. Even though they are typically very poor, these people have to pay far more for lighting than people in rich countries because they use inefficient kerosene lamps. Solar power costs half as much as lighting with kerosene.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/39544/?p1=MstCom |title=In the Developing World, Solar Is Cheaper than Fossil Fuels |author=Kevin Bullis |date=27 January 2012 |work=Technology Review }}</ref> As of 2010, an estimated 3 million households get power from small solar PV systems.<ref name=re10>REN21 (2010).

Micro-hydro configured into mini-grids also provide power. Over 44 million households use [[biogas]] made in household-scale digesters for [[lighting]] and/or [[cooking]], and more than 166 million households rely on a new generation of more-efficient biomass cookstoves.<ref name=""REN21 2011 14""/> Clean liquid fuel sourced from renewable feedstocks are used for cooking and lighting in energy-poor areas of the developing world. Alcohol fuels (ethanol and methanol) can be produced sustainably from non-food sugary, starchy, and cellulostic feedstocks.

Renewable energy projects in many developing countries have demonstrated that renewable energy can directly contribute to [[poverty reduction]] by providing the energy needed for creating businesses and employment. Renewable energy technologies can also make indirect contributions to alleviating poverty by providing energy for cooking, space heating, and lighting. Renewable energy can also contribute to education, by providing electricity to schools.<ref>[http://www.worldwatch.org/system/files/ren21-1.pdf Energy for Development: The Potential Role of Renewable Energy in Meeting the Millennium Development Goals] pp. 7–9.</ref>

U.S. President [[Barack Obama]]'s [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] includes more than $70 billion in direct spending and tax credits for clean energy and associated transportation programs. Leading renewable energy companies include [[First Solar]], [[Gamesa Corporación Tecnológica|Gamesa]], [[GE Energy]], [[Hanwha Q Cells]], [[Sharp Solar]], [[Siemens]], [[SunOpta]], [[Suntech Power]], and [[Vestas]].<ref>[[REN21]] (2008). [http://www.worldwatch.org/files/pdf/renewables2007.pdf Renewables 2007 Global Status Report (PDF)] p. 18.</ref>

Many national, state, and local governments have also created [[Green bank (financial institution)|green banks]]. A green bank is a quasi-public financial institution that uses public capital to leverage private investment in clean energy technologies.<ref>Ken Berlin, Reed Hundt, Marko Muro, and Devashree Saha. “State Clean Energy Banks: New Investment Facilities for Clean Energy Deployment”</ref> Green banks use a variety of financial tools to bridge market gaps that hinder the deployment of clean energy.

The military has also focused on the use of [[renewable fuels]] for military vehicles. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable fuels can be produced in any country, creating a strategic advantage. The US military has already committed itself to have 50% of its energy consumption come from alternative sources.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://nextnavy.com/air-force-cedes-the-green-lead-and-the-lede-to-navy/ |title=Air Force cedes the Green lead–and the lede–to Navy |first=Craig |last=Hooper |work=nextnavy.com |year=2011 |accessdate=27 December 2011}}</ref>

=== 100% renewable energy ===
{{Main article|100% renewable energy}}

The incentive to use 100% renewable energy, for electricity, transport, or even total primary energy supply globally, has been motivated by [[global warming]] and other ecological as well as economic concerns. The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand. [[Renewable energy commercialization|Renewable energy use]] has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated.<ref name=pg11>{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2013/04/100-percent-renewable-vision-building?amp;buffer_share=fdc06 |title=100 Percent Renewable Vision Building |author=Paul Gipe |date=4 April 2013 |work=Renewable Energy World }}</ref> At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply. Also, Professors S. Pacala and [[Robert H.

Using 100% renewable energy was first suggested in a [[Science (journal)|Science]] paper published in 1975 by Danish physicist [[Bent Sørensen (physicist)|Bent Sørensen]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sørensen | first1 = Bent | authorlink = Bent Sørensen (physicist) | year = 1975 | title = A plan is outlined according to which solar and wind energy would supply Denmark's needs by the year 2050 | url = | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 189 | issue = 4199| pages = 255–260 | doi = 10.1126/science.189.4199.255 | pmid=17813696}}</ref> It was followed by several other proposals, until in 1998 the first detailed analysis of scenarios with very high shares of renewables were published. These were followed by the first detailed 100% scenarios. In 2006 a PhD thesis was published by Czisch in which it was shown that in a 100% renewable scenario energy supply could match demand in every hour of the year in Europa and North Africa. In the same year Danish Energy professor [[Henrik Lund (academic)|Henrik Lund]] published a first paper<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lund | first1 = Henrik | authorlink = Henrik Lund (academic) | year = 2006 | title = Large-scale integration of optimal combinations of PV, wind and wave power into the electricity supply | url = | journal = [[Renewable Energy (journal)|Renewable Energy]] | volume = 31 | issue = 4| pages = 503–515 | doi = 10.1016/j.renene.2005.04.008 }}</ref> in which he addresses the optimal combination of renewables, which was followed by several other papers on the [[Energy transition|transition]] to 100% renewable energy in Denmark. Since then Lund has been publishing several papers on 100% renewable energy. After 2009 publications began to rise steeply, covering 100% scenarios for countries in Europa, America, Australia and other parts of the world.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hohmeyer | first1 = Olav | last2 = Bohm | first2 = Sönke | year = 2015 | title = Trends toward 100% renewable electricity supply in Germany and Europe: a paradigm shift in energy policies | url = | journal = Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Energy and Environment | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 74–97 | doi = 10.1002/wene.128 }}</ref>

In 2011 [[Mark Z. Jacobson]], professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, and Mark Delucchi published a study on 100% renewable global energy supply in the journal [[Energy Policy (journal)|Energy Policy]]. They found producing all new energy with [[wind power]], [[solar power]], and [[hydropower]] by 2030 is feasible and existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050. Barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be ""primarily social and political, not technological or economic"". They also found that energy costs with a wind, solar, water system should be similar to today's energy costs.<ref name=enpol2011>{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/DJEnPolicyPt2.pdf |title=Providing all global energy with wind, water, and solar power, Part II: Reliability, system and transmission costs, and policies |author1=Mark A.

Similarly, in the United States, the independent National Research Council has noted that ""sufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change, energy security, and the escalation of energy costs … Renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the United States, taken collectively, can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand."" .<ref name=NRC>{{cite web |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12619|title=Electricity from Renewable Resources: Status, Prospects, and Impediments |author=National Research Council| year=2010|pages=4|publisher=National Academies of Science}}</ref>

The most significant barriers to the widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low carbon energy strategies are primarily political and not technological. According to the 2013 ''Post Carbon Pathways'' report, which reviewed many international studies, the key roadblocks are: [[climate change denial]], the [[fossil fuels lobby]], political inaction, unsustainable energy consumption, outdated energy infrastructure, and financial constraints.<ref name=""John Wiseman et al"">{{cite web |url=http://www.postcarbonpathways.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Post-Carbon-Pathways-Report-2013_Final-V.pdf |title=Post Carbon Pathways |author=John Wiseman|date=April 2013 |work=University of Melbourne |display-authors=etal}}</ref>

There are numerous organizations within the academic, federal, and commercial sectors conducting large scale advanced research in the field of renewable energy. This research spans several areas of focus across the renewable energy spectrum. Most of the research is targeted at improving efficiency and increasing overall energy yields.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Increasing the energy yield of generation from new and renewable energy sources | journal = Renewable energy | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | year = 2007 | pages = 37–62 |author1=S.C.E.

* [[Cellulosic ethanol]]
: Several refineries that can process biomass and turn it into ethanol are built by companies such as [[Iogen Corporation|Iogen]], [[POET]], and [[Abengoa]], while other companies such as the [[Verenium Corporation]], [[Novozymes]], and Dyadic International<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dyadic.com/|title=Dyadic International - Bioenergy , Biopharmaceutical Enzymes|publisher=}}</ref> are producing enzymes which could enable future [[Cellulosic ethanol commercialization|commercialization]].

* [[Marine energy]]
[[File:Rance tidal power plant.JPG|thumb|[[Rance Tidal Power Station]], France]]

: Marine energy (also sometimes referred to as ocean energy) refers to the energy carried by [[ocean wave]]s, [[tide]]s, [[salinity]], and [[Ocean thermal energy conversion|ocean temperature differences]]. The movement of water in the world's oceans creates a vast store of [[kinetic energy]], or energy in motion. This energy can be harnessed to generate electricity to power homes, transport and industries. The term marine energy encompasses both [[wave power]]{{spaced ndash}}power from surface waves, and [[tidal power]]{{spaced ndash}}obtained from the kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water. [[Reverse electrodialysis]] (RED) is a technology for generating electricity by mixing fresh river water and salty sea water in large power cells designed for this purpose; as of 2016 it is being tested at a small scale (50 kW). [[Offshore wind power]] is not a form of marine energy, as wind power is derived from the [[wind]], even if the [[wind turbine]]s are placed over water. The [[ocean]]s have a tremendous amount of energy and are close to many if not most concentrated populations. Ocean energy has the potential of providing a substantial amount of new renewable energy around the world.<ref>Carbon Trust, ''Future Marine Energy.

*[[Solar-assisted heat pump]]
:A [[heat pump]] is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a ""heat sink"". Heat pumps are designed to move [[thermal energy]] opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. A solar-assisted heat pump represents the integration of a [[heat pump]] and [[Solar thermal collector|thermal solar panels]] in a single integrated system. Typically these two technologies are used separately (or only placing them in parallel) to produce [[Water heating|hot water]].<ref name = ref1>{{cite web| url = http://www.bine.info/en/publications/themeninfos/publikation/elektrisch-angetriebene-waermepumpen/waermepumpen-plus-solar/ | title = Solar-assisted heat pumps | language = en | access-date = 21 June 2016}}</ref> In this system the solar thermal panel performs the function of the low temperature heat source and the heat produced is used to feed the heat pump's evaporator.<ref name = ref2>{{cite web| url = http://www.climatizzazioneconfontirinnovabili.enea.it/index.php/pompe-di-calore-elioassistite | title = Pompe di calore elio-assistite | language = it | access-date = 21 June 2016}}</ref> The goal of this system is to get high [[Coefficient of performance|COP]] and then produce energy in a more [[Energy conversion efficiency|efficient]] and less expensive way.

:It is possible to use any type of solar thermal panel (sheet and tubes, roll-bond, heat pipe, thermal plates) or [[Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector|hybrid]] ([[Mono-crystalline silicon|mono]]/[[Polycrystalline silicon|polycrystalline]], [[Thin-film solar cell|thin film]]) in combination with the heat pump. The use of a hybrid panel is preferable because it allows to cover a part of the electricity demand of the heat pump and reduce the power consumption and consequently the [[variable cost]]s of the system.

* [[Solar updraft tower]] 
: The Solar updraft tower is a renewable-energy [[power plant]] for generating electricity from low temperature solar heat. Sunshine heats the air beneath a very wide greenhouse-like roofed collector structure surrounding the central base of a very tall [[chimney]] tower. The resulting [[convection]] causes a hot air updraft in the tower by the [[chimney effect]]. This airflow drives [[wind turbine]]s placed in the chimney updraft or around the chimney base to produce [[electricity]]. Plans for scaled-up versions of demonstration models will allow significant power generation, and may allow development of other applications, such as water extraction or distillation, and agriculture or horticulture.  A more advanced version of a similarly themed technology is the [[Vortex engine]] which aims to replace large physical chimneys with a [[vortex]] of air created by a shorter, less-expensive structure.

* [[Space-based solar power]]
: For either photovoltaic or thermal systems, one option is to loft them into space, particularly Geosynchronous orbit.  To be competitive with Earth-based solar power systems, the specific mass (kg/kW) times the cost to loft mass plus the cost of the parts needs to be $2400 or less.  I.e., for a parts cost plus rectenna of $1100/kW, the product of the $/kg and kg/kW must be $1300/kW or less.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spacejournal.ohio.edu/issue18/thermalpower.html|title=Online Journal of Space Communication|first=Online Journal of Space|last=Communication|website=spacejournal.ohio.edu}}</ref>  Thus for 6.5&nbsp;kg/kW, the transport cost cannot exceed $200/kg.  While that will require a 100 to one reduction, SpaceX is targeting a ten to one reduction, Reaction Engines may make a 100 to one reduction possible.

{{Main article|Renewable energy debate|Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy|Green job}}

Renewable electricity production, from sources such as wind power and solar power, is sometimes criticized for being variable or [[Intermittent power source|intermittent]], but is not true for concentrated solar, geothermal and biofuels, that have continuity. In any case, the [[International Energy Agency]] has stated that deployment of renewable technologies usually increases the diversity of electricity sources and, through local generation, contributes to the flexibility of the system and its resistance to central shocks.<ref>[[International Energy Agency]] (2007).

While renewables have been very successful in their ever-growing contribution to electrical power there are no countries dominated by fossil fuels who have a [[Fossil fuel phase-out|plan to stop]] and get that power from renwables. Only Scotland and Ontario have stopped burning coal, largely due to good natural gas supplies. In the area of transportation, fossil fuels are even more entrenched and solutions harder to find.<ref>https://www.iea.org/media/training/presentations/Day_2_Renewables_5_Transport.pdf</ref> It's unclear if there are failures with policy or renewable energy, but twenty years after the Kyoto Protocol  fossil fuels are still our primary energy source and consumption continues to grow.<ref>http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html</ref>

== Environmental impact ==
{{Main|Renewable Heat Incentive scandal|Operation Car Wash|Biomass#Environmental damage}}
The ability of [[biomass]] and [[biofuels]] to contribute to a reduction in {{CO2}} emissions is limited because both biomass and biofuels emit large amounts of air pollution when burned and in some cases compete with food supply. Furthermore, biomass and biofuels consume large amounts of water.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12039&page=45 |title =Water Issues of Biofuel Production Plants |author=The National Academies Press |year=2008|accessdate = 31 March 2017 |journal=The National Academies Press}}</ref> Other renewable sources such as [[wind power]], [[photovoltaics]], and [[hydroelectricity]] have the advantage of being able to conserve water, lower pollution and reduce {{CO2}} emissions.

== History ==
Over the past 30 years,{{when|date=December 2013}} significant findings regarding [[global warming]] highlighted the need to curb carbon emissions. From this, the idea for low carbon power was born. The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC), established by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) and the [[United Nations Environment Program]] (UNEP) in 1988, set the scientific precedence for the introduction of low carbon power. The IPCC has continued to provide scientific, technical and socio-economic advice to the world community, through its periodic assessment reports and special reports.<ref>[http://www.ipcc.ch/about/about.htm Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Web site]</ref>

Internationally, the most prominent early step in the direction of low carbon power was the signing of the [[Kyoto Protocol]], which came into force on February 16, 2005, under which most industrialized countries committed to reduce their carbon emissions. The historical event set the political precedence for introduction of low carbon power technology.

On a social level, perhaps the biggest factor contributing to the general public’s awareness of climate change and the need for new technologies, including low carbon power, came from the documentary ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'', which clarified and highlighted the problem of global warming.

== Power sources by carbon dioxide emissions ==
{{Main article|Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources}}

=== Vattenfall study ===
[[Image:Greenhouse emissions by electricity source.PNG|300px|right|The Vattenfall study found nuclear, hydro, and wind to have far less greenhouse emissions than other sources represented.]]

The Swedish utility [[Vattenfall]] did a study of full life cycle emissions of nuclear, hydro, coal, gas, peat and wind which the utility uses to produce electricity. The result of the study  concluded that the grams of CO<sub>2</sub> per kWh of electricity by source is nuclear(5), hydroelectric(9), wind(15), natural gas(503), peat(636), coal(781).<ref>vattenfall.com. [https://corporate.vattenfall.com/globalassets/corporate/sustainability/reports/life_cycle_assessment.pdf]</ref>

===Sovacool life cycle study survey===
[[Image:Sovacool 2008 life-cycle study.png|thumb|right|Sovacool says that the mean value of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for nuclear power over the life cycle of a plant was 66.08 g/kWh.]]

A 2008 [[meta analysis]], ""Valuing the use Gas Emissions from Nuclear Power: A Critical Survey,""<ref>Benjamin K. Sovacool. [http://www.nirs.org/climate/background/sovacool_nuclear_ghg.pdf Valuing the greenhouse gas emissions from nuclear power: A critical survey] ''[[Energy Policy (journal)|Energy Policy]]'', Vol. 36, 2008, pp. 2940-2953.</ref> by [[Benjamin K. Sovacool]], analysed 103 life cycle studies of greenhouse gas-equivalent emissions for nuclear power plants. The studies surveyed included the 1997 Vattenfall comparative emissions study, among others. Sovacool's analysis calculated that the mean value of emissions over the lifetime of a nuclear power plant is 66 g/kWh. Comparative results for [[wind power]], [[hydroelectricity]], [[solar thermal power]], and [[solar photovoltaic]], were 9-10 g/kWh, 10-13 g/kWh, 13 g/kWh and 32 g/kWh respectively.<ref>Benjamin K. Sovacool. [http://www.nirs.org/climate/background/sovacool_nuclear_ghg.pdf Valuing the greenhouse gas emissions from nuclear power: A critical survey].

=== Yale University life cycle analysis of nuclear power ===
A 2012 [[life cycle assessment]] (LCA) review by [[Yale University]] said that ""depending on conditions, median life cycle [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] emissions [for nuclear electricity generation technologies] could be 9 to 110 g {{CO2}}-eq/kWh by 2050.""  It stated:<ref>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00472.x/full Life Cycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Nuclear Electricity Generation. ''J of Ind Ecology''</ref>{{Quote|""The collective LCA literature indicates that life cycle GHG emissions from nuclear power are only a fraction of traditional fossil sources and comparable to renewable technologies.""}} 
It added that for the most common category of reactors, the [[Light water reactor]] (LWR):
{{Quote|""Harmonization decreased the [[median]] estimate for all LWR technology categories so that the [[median]]s of [[Boiling water reactor|BWRs]], [[Pressurized water reactor|PWRs]], and all LWRs are similar, at approximately 12 g {{CO2}}-eq/kWh""}}

== Differentiating attributes of low-carbon power sources ==
There are many options for lowering current levels of carbon emissions. Some options, such as wind power and solar power, produce low quantities of total life cycle carbon emissions, using entirely renewable sources. Other options, such as nuclear power, produce a comparable amount of carbon dioxide emissions as renewable technologies in total life cycle emissions, but consume non-renewable, but sustainable<ref>http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2012/ph241/chowdhury2/</ref> materials ([[uranium]]). The term low carbon power can also include power that continues to utilize the world’s natural resources, such as natural gas and coal, but only when they employ techniques that reduce carbon dioxide emissions from these sources when burning them for fuel, such as the, as of 2012, pilot plants performing [[Carbon capture and storage]].<ref name=""gov.uk""/><ref>http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2012/05/120522-carbon-capture-and-storage-economic-hurdles/</ref>

As the single [[List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions|largest emitter]] of carbon dioxide in the United States, the electric-power industry accounted for 39% of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 2004, a 27% increase since 1990.<ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0406/p03s03-sten.html The Christian Science Monitor; “New case for regulating CO<sub>2</sub> emissions”]</ref> Because the cost of reducing emissions in the electricity sector appears to be lower than in other sectors such as transportation, the electricity sector may deliver the largest proportional carbon reductions under an economically efficient climate policy.<ref name=issues>[http://www.issues.org/23.3/apt.html Issues in Science & Technology Online; “Promoting Low-Carbon Electricity Production”]</ref>

Technologies to produce electric power with low-carbon emissions are already in use at various scales. Together, they account for roughly 28% of all U.S. electric-power production, with nuclear power representing the majority (20%), followed by hydroelectric power (7%).<ref name=issues /> However, demand for power is increasing, driven by increased population and per capita demand, and low carbon power can supplement the supply needed.<ref>[http://www.pewclimate.org/global-warming-in-depth/all_reports/electricity/ex__summary.cfm The Pew Center on Global Climate Change; “Global Warming in Depth”]</ref>

Although the methodological integrity of this paper was challenged by, Marco Raugei, in late 2013.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544213006373 |title=Comments on ""Energy intensities, EROIs (energy returned on invested), and energy payback times of electricity generating power plants""—Making clear of quite some confusion. | doi=10.1016/j.energy.2013.07.032 | volume=59 |journal=Energy |pages=781–782}}</ref> The authors of the initial paper responded to each of Raugei's concerns in 2014, and after analysis, each of Raugei's concerns were summarized as ""not scientifically justified"" and based on faulty EROEI understandings due to ""politically motivated energy evaluations"".<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544214001601 |title=Reply on ""Comments on ‘Energy intensities, EROIs (energy returned on invested), and energy payback times of electricity generating power plants’ – Making clear of quite some confusion"" | doi=10.1016/j.energy.2014.02.026 | volume=68 |journal=Energy |pages=1004–1006}}</ref> In a second reply in 2014, Marco Raugei et al. re-explained their critisism and concluded once again that ""there appears to be ample reason to question the reliability of the authors' numerical results, and, most importantly, their internal as well as external combarability to those produced by previously published studies"".<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544214014327 |title=Rebuttal: ""Comments on ‘Energy intensities, EROIs (energy returned on invested), and energy payback times of electricity generating power plants’ – Making clear of quite some confusion"" | doi=10.1016/j.energy.2014.12.060 | volume=82 |journal=Energy |pages=1088–1091}}</ref>

== Examples of low carbon power technology ==

The 2014 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report identifies nuclear, wind, solar and hydroelectricity in suitable locations as technologies that can provide electricity with less than 5% of the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of coal power.<ref>http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg3/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter7.pdf</ref>

=== Hydroelectric power ===
[[File:Hoovernewbridge.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Hoover Dam]] when completed in 1936 was both the world's largest electric-power generating station and the world's largest concrete structure.]]

[[Hydroelectric]] plants have the advantage of being long-lived and many existing plants have operated for more than 100 years. Hydropower is also an extremely flexible technology from the perspective of power grid operation. Large hydropower provides one of the lowest cost options in today’s energy market, even compared to fossil fuels and there are no harmful emissions associated with plant operation.<ref name=""IEA"">International Energy Agency (2007).
[http://www.iea.org/textbase/papers/2006/renewable_factsheet.pdf ''Renewables in global energy supply: An IEA facts sheet''] (PDF), OECD, p. 3.</ref> However there are typically low greenhouse gas emissions with [[reservoir]]s, and possibly high emissions in the tropics.

Hydroelectric power is the world’s largest low carbon source of electricity, supplying 16.6% of total electricity in 2014.<ref>http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/REN12-GSR2015_Onlinebook_low1.pdf</ref> [[Electricity sector in China#Hydropower|China]] is by far the world's largest producer of [[hydroelectricity]] in the world, followed by [[Electricity sector in Brazil|Brazil]] and [[Hydroelectric power in Canada|Canada]].

However, there are several significant social and environmental disadvantages of large-scale hydroelectric power systems: dislocation, if people are living where the reservoirs are planned, release of [[Greenhouse gas#Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|significant amounts of carbon dioxide and methane]] during construction and flooding of the reservoir, and disruption of aquatic ecosystems and birdlife.<ref>Duncan Graham-Rowe. [http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7046 Hydroelectric power's dirty secret revealed] ''New Scientist'', 24 February 2005.</ref> There is a strong consensus now that countries should adopt an integrated approach towards managing water resources, which would involve planning hydropower development in co-operation with other water-using sectors.<ref name=""IEA""/>

=== Nuclear power ===
[[File:Advanced Test Reactor.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Blue [[Cherenkov]] light being produced near the core of the Fission powered [[Advanced Test Reactor]]]]
[[Nuclear power]], with a 10.6% share of world electricity production as of 2013, is the second largest low-carbon power source.<ref>http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld_Statistics_2015.pdf pg25</ref>

Nuclear power, in 2010, also provided two thirds(2/3) of the twenty seven nation [[European Union]]'s low-carbon energy.<ref>http://ec.europa.eu/energy/publications/doc/2010_setplan_brochure.pdf  The European Strategic Energy Technology Plan SET-Plan Towards a low-carbon future 2010. Nuclear power provides ""2/3 of the EU's low carbon energy"" pg 6.</ref> With for example some EU nations sourcing a considerable amount of their electricity from nuclear power, for example [[Nuclear power in France|France derives 79% of its electricity from nuclear]].

According to the [[IAEA]] and [[European Nuclear Society]], worldwide there were 68 civil nuclear power reactors under construction in 15 countries in 2013.<ref>http://www.iaea.org/pris/</ref><ref name=""euronuclear.org"">http://www.euronuclear.org/info/encyclopedia/n/nuclear-power-plant-world-wide.htm</ref> China has 29 of these nuclear power reactors under construction, as of 2013, with plans to build many more,<ref name=""euronuclear.org""/><ref name=""Nuclear Power in China"">World Nuclear Association (December 10, 2010).

[http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/07/nuclear-renaissance-is-short-on-largess/ Nuclear ‘Renaissance’ Is Short on Largess] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref>  There are also a considerable number of new reactors being built in South Korea, India, and Russia.
[[File:Net US Electric Generation for 2009.jpg|thumb|350px|This graph illustrates [[nuclear power]] is the United States's largest contributor of non-greenhouse-gas-emitting electric power generation, comprising nearly three-quarters of the non-emitting sources.]]
Nuclear power's capability to add significantly to future low carbon energy growth depends on several factors, including the economics of new reactor designs, such as [[Generation III reactor]]s, public opinion and national and regional politics.

The 104 U.S. nuclear plants are undergoing a [[Light Water Reactor Sustainability Program]], to sustainably extend the life span of the U.S. nuclear fleet by a further 20 years. With further US power plants under construction in 2013, such as the two [[AP1000]]s at [[Vogtle Electric Generating Plant]]. However the [[Economics of new nuclear power plants]] are still evolving and plans to add to those plants are mostly in flux.<ref>[https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-reactors/col/new-reactor-map.html Location of Projected New Nuclear Power Reactors]</ref>

=== Solar power ===
{{Main article|Solar power}}
[[Image:PS10 solar power tower.jpg|thumb|right|The [[PS10 solar power tower|PS10]] concentrates sunlight from a field of heliostats on a central tower.]]
Solar power is the conversion of [[sunlight]] into electricity, either directly using [[photovoltaics]] (PV), or indirectly using [[concentrated solar power]] (CSP). Concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Photovoltaics convert light into electric current using the [[photoelectric effect]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Energy Sources: Solar|url=https://www.energy.gov/energysources/solar.htm|work=Department of Energy|accessdate=19 April 2011}}</ref>

Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s.  The 354 MW [[SEGS]] CSP installation is the largest solar power plant in the world, located in the [[Mojave Desert]] of California.  Other large CSP plants include the [[Solnova Solar Power Station]] (150 MW) and the [[Andasol solar power station]] (150 MW), both in Spain. The over 200 MW [[Agua Caliente Solar Project]] in the United States, and the 214 MW [[Charanka Solar Park]] in India, are the [[List of photovoltaic power stations|world’s largest]] [[photovoltaic plant]]s. Solar power's share of worldwide electricity usage at the end of 2014 was 1%.<ref name=""ren21.net""/>

=== Geothermal power ===
{{Main article|Geothermal electricity}}
Geothermal electricity is [[electricity generation|electricity generated]] from geothermal energy. Technologies in use include dry steam power plants, flash steam power plants and binary cycle power plants. Geothermal electricity generation is used in 24 countries<ref name=gea2010>Geothermal Energy Association.

=== Tidal power ===
[[Tidal power]] is a form of [[hydropower]] that converts the energy of tides into electricity or other useful forms of power. The first large-scale tidal power plant (the [[Rance Tidal Power Station]]) started operation in 1966. Although not yet widely used, tidal power has potential for future electricity generation. Tides are more predictable than wind energy and solar power.

=== Carbon capture and storage ===
{{See also|Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources}}
[[Carbon capture and storage]] captures carbon dioxide from the [[flue gas]] of power plants or other industry, transporting it to an appropriate location where it can be buried securely in an underground reservoir. While the technologies involved are all in use, and carbon capture and storage is occurring in other industries (e.g., at the [[Sleipner gas field]]), no large scale integrated project has yet become operational within the power industry.

Improvements to current carbon capture and storage technologies could reduce CO<sub>2</sub> capture costs by at least 20-30% over approximately the next decade, while new technologies under development promise more substantial cost reduction.<ref name=""netl"" />

=== Emissions ===
[[Image:Greenhouse Gas by Sector.png|thumb| Greenhouse gas emissions by sector. See [http://cait.wri.org/figures.php?page=World-FlowChart&view=100 World Resources Institute] for detailed breakdown]]
The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] stated in its first working group report that “most of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] greenhouse gas concentrations, contribute to [[climate change]].<ref>[http://www.ipcc.ch/SPM2feb07.pdf Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.

As a percentage of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) accounts for 72 percent,<ref>[[Greenhouse gas]]</ref> and has increased in concentration in the atmosphere from 315 parts per million (ppm) in 1958 to more than 375 ppm in 2005.<ref>[http://cdiac.ornl.gov/trends/co2/graphics/mlo145e_thrudc04.pdf Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC), the primary climate-change data and information analysis center of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)]</ref>

Emissions from energy make up more than 61.4 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions.<ref name=""wri"">[http://www.wri.org/climate/topic_content.cfm?cid=4177 World Resources Institute; “Greenhouse Gases and Where They Come From”]</ref> Power generation from traditional coal fuel sources accounts for 18.8 percent of all world greenhouse gas emissions, nearly double that emitted by road transportation.<ref name=""wri"" />

Estimates state that by 2020 the world will be producing around twice as much carbon emissions as it was in 2000.<ref>[http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/FTPROOT/presentations/ieo99_3im/sld006.htm Energy Information Administration; “World Carbon Emissions by Region”]</ref>

=== Electricity usage ===
[[Image:GHG by region.jpg|thumb|World CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by region]]

World energy consumption is predicted to increase from 421 quadrillion British Thermal Units (BTU) in 2003 to 722 quadrillion BTU in 2030.<ref>[http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/ieo/figure_7.html Energy Information Administration; “International Energy Outlook 2006”]</ref> Coal consumption is predicted to nearly double in that same time.<ref>[http://timeforchange.org/prediction-of-energy-consumption Time for Change,org; “Prediction of Energy Consumption World-Wide”]</ref> The fastest growth is seen in non-[[OECD]] Asian countries, especially China and India, where economic growth drives increased energy use.<ref>[http://www.eia.doe.gov/neic/press/images/06-03-1.gif Energy Information Administration; “World Market Energy Consumption by Region”]</ref> By implementing low carbon power options, world electricity demand could continue to grow while maintaining stable carbon emission levels.

In the transportation sector there are moves away from fossil fuels and towards electric vehicles, such as [[mass transit]] and the [[electric car]]. These trends are small, but may eventually add a large demand to the electrical grid.

Domestic and industrial heat and hot water have largely been supplied by burning fossil fuels such as fuel oil or natural gas at the consumers premises. Some countries have begun heat pump rebates to encourage switching to electricity, potentially adding a large demand to the grid.<ref>http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/domestic/air-source-heat-pumps</ref>

26787212,2010-04-01 15:01:00-05,Reverse electrodialysis,"'''Reverse electrodialysis''' ('''RED''') is the [[salinity gradient]] energy retrieved from the difference in the salt [[concentration]] between [[seawater]] and [[Fresh water|river water]].<ref>[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1980OcEng...7....1L 1980 - energy by reverse electrodialysis]</ref> A method of utilizing the energy produced by this process by means of a heat engine was invented by Prof. [[Sidney Loeb]] in 1977 at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.
[http://www.google.com/patents/US4171409 --United States Patent US4171409]

In reverse [[electrodialysis]] a salt solution and fresh water are let through a stack of alternating cation and anion exchange membranes. The chemical potential difference between salt and fresh water generates a voltage over each membrane and the total potential of the system is the sum of the potential differences over all membranes. It is important to remember that the process works through difference in ion concentration instead of an electric field, which has implications for the type of membrane needed.<ref>[http://mtg.tnw.utwente.nl/teaching/assign/blue/ See note 2]</ref>

In RED, as in a [[fuel cell]], the cells are stacked. A module with a capacity of 250&nbsp;kW has the size of a shipping container.

In the [[Netherlands]], for example, more than 3,300 m³ fresh water runs into the sea per second on average. The membrane halves the pressure differences which results in a water column of approximately 135&nbsp;meters. The energy potential is therefore e=[[Potential energy#Gravitational potential energy|mg&Delta;h]]=3.3*10<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;kg/s*10&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup>*135&nbsp;meters ca.= 4.5*10<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;[[Joule]] per second, Power=4.5 gigawatts.
<!--
These numbers do not work out correctly: see Talk. Theoretically the output is 2.5 MJ or 0.5 kWh/m³. This corresponds to about 3,000 MW, which is about one-third of the national electricity consumption ([[2005]]).

""14*3300 bars m^3/sec"" yields 4.6 GW (type it into a Google search box) so the numbers work out okay.~~~

18965585,2017-07-01 20:59:00-05,Pressure-retarded osmosis,"'''Pressure retarded osmosis''' ('''PRO''') is a technique to separate a solvent (for example, [[fresh water]]) from a solution that is more concentrated (e.g. [[sea water]]) and also pressurized. A [[semipermeable membrane]] allows the solvent to pass to the concentrated solution side by [[osmosis]].<ref>[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037673881300865X]</ref> The technique can be used to generate power from the [[salinity gradient]] energy resulting from the difference in the salt concentration between sea and river water.
In PRO, the [[water potential]] between [[fresh water]] and sea water corresponds to a pressure of 26 [[Bar (unit)|bar]]s. This pressure is equivalent to a column of water ([[hydraulic head]]) 270 meters high.
<ref>[http://www.statkraft.com/energy-sources/osmotic-power/default.aspx How does it work?] - [[Statkraft]]</ref>
However, the optimal working pressure is  only half of this, 11 to 15 bar.

== History ==

This method of generating power was invented by [[Sidney Loeb|Prof. Sidney Loeb]] in 1973 at the [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]], [[Beersheba]], Israel.<ref>Israel Patent Application 42658. (July 3, 1973) [http://www.google.com/patents/US3906250 United States patent 3906250]. (Erroneously shows Israel priority as 1974 instead of 1973).
</ref>

In 2014 researchers verified that 95% of a PRO system's theoretical power output can be produced with a membrane that is half (or less) the size needed for achieving 100%. Output is proportional to the salinity. Desalination yields very salty brine, while treated municipal wastewater has relatively little salt. Combining those streams could produce energy to power both facilities. However, powering an existing wastewater treatment plant by mixing treated wastewater with seawater could require a membrane area of 2.5 million square meters.<ref>[https://online.wsj.com/articles/a-new-kind-of-power-from-salt-water-1409337076]</ref>

To deal with these membrane requirements, scientists are working on rolled membranes <ref>""A New Kind of Power from Salt Water"" Wall St. Journal, August 29–31, 2014 [https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-new-kind-of-power-from-salt-water-1409337076]</ref> that will take up much less space.

65499,2017-08-23 19:05:00-05,Soil salinity,"'''Soil salinity''' is the [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] content in the [[soil]]; the process of increasing the salt content is known as '''salinization'''.<ref>[http://europeandcis.undp.org/WaterWiki/index.php/Soil_salinity  from ""Soil salinity"" in WaterWiki, the on-line Knowledge and Collaboration Tool of the Community of Practice (CoP) on Water- and UNDP-related activities in Central and South-Eastern Europe, Caucasus and Central Asia.]
</ref> Salts occur naturally within soils and water. Salination can be caused by natural processes such as [[mineral weathering]] or by the gradual withdrawal of an ocean. It can also come about through artificial processes such as [[irrigation]].

==Natural occurrence==
[[Salt]]s are a natural component in soils and water.
The ions responsible for salination are: Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Cl<sup>−</sup>.<br>
As the Na<sup>+</sup> (sodium) predominates, soils can become '''sodic'''.  [[Sodic soil]]s present particular challenges because they tend to have very poor structure which limits or prevents [[water infiltration]] and drainage.

Over long periods of time, as soil minerals [[weathering|weather]] and release salts, these salts are flushed or leached out of the soil by drainage water in areas with sufficient precipitation.  In addition to mineral weathering, salts are also deposited via dust and precipitation.  In dry regions salts may accumulate, leading to naturally saline soils.  This is the case, for example, in [[Salinity in Australia|large parts of Australia]]. Human practices can increase the salinity of soils by the addition of salts in irrigation water.  Proper irrigation management can prevent salt accumulation by providing adequate drainage water to leach added salts from the soil.  Disrupting drainage patterns that provide leaching can also result in salt accumulations.  An example of this occurred in [[Egypt]] in 1970 when the [[Aswan dam|Aswan High Dam]] was built. The change in the level of [[ground water]] before the construction had enabled [[soil erosion]], which led to high concentration of salts in the water table. After the construction, the continuous high level of the water table led to the salination of the [[arable land]].

==Dry land salinity==
[[dryland salinity|Salinity in drylands]] can occur when the water table is between two and three metres from the surface of the soil.  The salts from the groundwater are raised by capillary action to the surface of the soil. This occurs when groundwater is saline (which is true in many areas), and is favored by land use practices allowing more rainwater to enter the aquifer than it could accommodate. For example, the clearing of trees for agriculture is a major reason for dryland salinity in some areas, since deep rooting of trees has been replaced by shallow rooting of annual crops.

==Salinity due to irrigation==
[[Image:Salinity from irrigation.png|thumb|400px|Rain or irrigation, in the absence of leaching, can bring salts to the surface by capillary action]]
{{Main article|Environmental impacts of irrigation}}
Salinity from [[irrigation]] can occur over time wherever irrigation occurs, since almost all water (even natural rainfall) contains some dissolved salts.<ref>{{Citation | author = ILRI | title = Effectiveness and Social/Environmental Impacts of Irrigation Projects: a Review  | series = In: Annual Report 1988 of the International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI) | year = 1989 | pages = 18–34 | location = Wageningen, The Netherlands | url = http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/irreff.pdf }}</ref> When the plants use the water, the salts are left behind in the soil and eventually begin to accumulate.  Since soil salinity makes it more difficult for plants to absorb soil moisture, these salts must be leached out of the plant root zone by applying additional water.  This water in excess of plant needs is called the [[Leaching model|leaching fraction]].  Salination from irrigation water is also greatly increased by poor [[drainage]] and [[Biosalinity|use of saline water]] for irrigating agricultural crops.

Salinity in urban areas often results from the combination of irrigation and groundwater processes. Irrigation is also now common in cities (gardens and recreation areas).

==Consequences of salinity==
The consequences of salinity are
* detrimental effects on plant growth and yield
* damage to infrastructure (roads, bricks, corrosion of pipes and cables)
* reduction of water quality for users, sedimentation problems
* [[soil erosion]] ultimately, when crops are too strongly affected by the amounts of salts.

Salinity is an important [[land degradation]] problem. Soil salinity can be reduced by [[leaching (agriculture)|leaching]] soluble salts out of soil with excess irrigation water.  [[Soil salinity control]] involves [[watertable control]] and [[leaching model|flushing]] in combination with [[tile drainage]] or another form of [[Drainage system (agriculture)|subsurface drainage]].<ref>{{Citation | title = Drainage Manual: A Guide to Integrating Plant, Soil, and Water Relationships for Drainage of Irrigated Lands  | year = 1993 | publisher =  Interior Dept., Bureau of Reclamation | isbn = 0-16-061623-9}}</ref><ref name=""Waterlog"">{{cite web |url=http://www.waterlog.info |title=Free articles and software on drainage of waterlogged land and soil salinity control |accessdate=2010-07-28 }}</ref> A comprehensive treatment of soil salinity is available from the [[United Nations]] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]].<ref>Salt-Affected Soils and their Management, FAO Soils Bulletin 39 (http://www.fao.org/docrep/x5871e/x5871e00.htm)</ref>

==Salt tolerance of crops==
{{see|Maas–Hoffman model|Van Genuchten–Gupta model}}
High levels of soil salinity can be tolerated if salt-tolerant plants are grown.  Sensitive crops lose their vigor already in slightly saline soils, most crops are negatively affected by (moderately) saline soils, and only salinity resistant crops thrive in severely saline soils.

213555,2017-08-27 12:48:00-05,Solar updraft tower,"The '''solar updraft tower''' (SUT) is a [[renewable energy|renewable-energy]] [[power plant]] for generating electricity from low temperature solar heat. Sunshine heats the air beneath a very wide greenhouse-like roofed collector structure surrounding the central base of a very tall [[chimney]] tower. The resulting [[convection]] causes a hot air updraft in the tower by the [[chimney effect]]. This airflow drives [[wind turbine]]s placed in the chimney updraft or around the chimney base to produce [[electricity]].  Plans for scaled-up versions of demonstration models will allow significant power generation, and may allow development of other applications, such as water extraction or distillation, and agriculture or horticulture.

Commercial investment may have been discouraged by the high initial cost of building a very large novel structure, the large land area required and by the risk of investment, however, there appears to be a renewed interest in solar updraft towers especially in sunny remote areas. A few prototypes have recently been constructed and projects are being proposed for parts of Africa, USA and Australia. An important fact to consider is that solar updraft towers appear to be the only renewable energy technology that can generate electricity from low temperature heat.  Functional or mechanical feasibility is not so much an issue now as capitalisation.<ref name=""news.nationalgeographic.com"">http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2014/04/140416-solar-updraft-towers-convert-hot-air-to-energy/{{full|date=June 2017}}</ref>

A comprehensive review of theoretical and experimental aspects of the solar updraft tower power plant (SUTPP) development is available, with a recommendation for commercial development.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.solener.2014.06.029 |title=Solar updraft tower power generation |journal=Solar Energy |volume=128 |pages=95–125 |year=2016 |last1=Zhou |first1=Xinping |last2=Xu |first2=Yangyang |bibcode=2016SoEn..128...95Z }}</ref>  A popular update with interview of an informed engineering proponent has been published in National Geographic in 2014.<ref name=""news.nationalgeographic.com""/>

== Design ==
Power output depends primarily on two factors: collector area and chimney height. A larger area collects and warms a greater volume of air to flow up the chimney; collector areas as large as {{convert|7|km|mi|1}} in diameter have been discussed. A larger chimney height increases the pressure difference via the [[stack effect]]; chimneys as tall as {{convert|1000|m|ft|0}} have been discussed.<ref>{{cite book|title=Renewable energy technology, economics, and environment|date=2007|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-540-70949-7|page=223|editor=Martin Kaltschmitt|editor-link=Martin Kaltschmitt|editor2=Wolfgang Streicher|editor3=Andreas Wiese}}</ref>

Heat is stored inside the collector area allowing SUTs to operate 24 hours a day. The ground beneath the solar collector, water in bags or tubes, or a [[solar pond|saltwater thermal sink]] in the collector could add thermal capacity and inertia to the collector.  Humidity of the updraft and condensation in the chimney could increase the energy flux of the system.<ref name=""Solar pond tower for 5 €ct/kWh"">{{cite web|url=http://www.greenidealive.org/110599/466/solar-pond-tower-for-5-ct/kwh.html |title=Solar pond tower for 5 €ct/kWh|publisher=GreenIdeaLive |accessdate=2011-09-11}}</ref><ref name=""Schlaich"">{{cite journal |doi=10.1115/1.1823493 |title=Design of Commercial Solar Updraft Tower Systems—Utilization of Solar Induced Convective Flows for Power Generation |journal=Journal of Solar Energy Engineering |volume=127 |pages=117–24 |year=2005 |last1=Schlaich |first1=Jörg |last2=Bergermann |first2=Rudolf |last3=Schiel |first3=Wolfgang |last4=Weinrebe |first4=Gerhard }}</ref>

[[Wind turbine|Turbines]] with a horizontal axis can be installed in a ring around the base of the tower, as once planned for an Australian project and seen in the diagram above; or—as in the prototype in Spain—a single vertical axis turbine can be installed inside the chimney.

A near negligible amount of [[Carbon dioxide]] is produced as part of operations, while construction material manufacturing can create emissions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Niemann|first=H.-J|last2=Lupi|first2=F|last3=Hoeffer|first3=R|last4=Hubert|first4=W|last5=Borri|first5=C|date=2009-01-01|title=The Solar Updraft Power Plant: Design and Optimization of the Tower for Wind Effects|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265229926_The_Solar_Updraft_Power_Plant_Design_and_Optimization_of_the_Tower_for_Wind_Effects|journal=ResearchGate}}</ref> Net energy payback is estimated to be 2–3 years.<ref name=""Schlaich""/>

Since solar collectors occupy significant amounts of land, deserts and other low-value sites are most likely. Improvements in the solar heat collection efficiency by using unglazed [[transpired collector]] can significantly reduce the land required for the solar array.

A small-scale solar updraft tower may be an attractive option for remote regions in developing countries.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.fuel.2006.04.029 |title=The potential of solar chimney for application in rural areas of developing countries |journal=Fuel |volume=85 |issue=17–18 |pages=2561–6 |year=2006 |last1=Onyango |first1=F |last2=Ochieng |first2=R }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0960-1481(02)00227-6 |id={{INIST|14497497}} |title=Case study of solar chimney power plants in Northwestern regions of China |journal=Renewable Energy |volume=28 |issue=8 |pages=1295–304 |year=2003 |last1=Dai |first1=Y.J |last2=Huang |first2=H.B |last3=Wang |first3=R.Z }}</ref> The relatively low-tech approach could allow local resources and labour to be used for construction and maintenance.

Locating a tower at high latitudes could produce up to 85 per cent of the output of a similar plant located closer to the equator, if the collection area is sloped significantly toward the equator. The sloped collector field, which also functions as a chimney, is built on suitable mountainsides, with a short vertical chimney on the mountaintop to accommodate the vertical axis air turbine. The results showed that solar chimney power plants at high latitudes may have satisfactory thermal performance.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.solener.2005.01.003 |id={{INIST|17275884}} |title=Solar chimney power plants for high latitudes |journal=Solar Energy |volume=79 |issue=5 |pages=449–58 |year=2005 |last1=Bilgen |first1=E. |last2=Rheault |first2=J. |bibcode=2005SoEn...79..449B }}</ref>

== History ==

A chimney turbine was envisioned as a [[Roasting jack#Smoke jack|smoke jack]], and illustrated 500 years ago by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].  An animal spitted above a fire or in an oven could be turned by a vertical axis turbine with four angled vanes in the chimney updraft. [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Smoke-jack.jpg]

In 1896, Mr. Alfred Rosling Bennett published the first patent describing a ""Convection Mill"" [http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=GB&NR=189608711]. Even if in the title of the Patent and in the claims the word ""Toy"" clearly appears and even if in the overall description made inside the Patent it is evident that the idea was to produce small devices, in page 3 at lines 49-54 Bennett envisions much larger devices for bigger scale applications. A model of this ""convection mill"", built in 1919 by Albert H. Holmes & Son (London) to demonstrate the phenomenon of convection currents, is on display in the [[Science Museum, London]].

In 1903, Isidoro Cabanyes, a colonel in the Spanish army, proposed a solar chimney power plant in the magazine ''La energía eléctrica''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lorenzo |language=Spanish |url=http://www.fotovoltaica.com/chimenea.pdf |format=PDF |title=Las chimeneas solares:De una propuesta española en 1903 a la Central de Manzanares |publisher=De Los Archivos Históricos De La Energía Solar}}</ref> Another early description was published in 1931 by German author [[Walter de Haas|Hanns Günther]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Günther |first=Hanns | authorlink=Walter de Haas | date=1931| title=In hundert Jahren — Die künftige Energieversorgung der Welt| location=Stuttgart| publisher=Kosmos, Gesellschaft der Naturfreunde}}</ref> Beginning in 1975, Robert E.

A second solar updraft tower using a [[transpired collector]] is operating at Trakya University in Edirne Turkey and is being used to test various innovations in SUT designs including the ability to recover heat from photovoltaic (PV) arrays.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}
[[File:Solar power tower with PV.jpg|thumbnail|Solar towers can incorporate photovoltaic (PV) modules on transpired collectors for additional day time output and the heat from PV array is utilised by the solar tower]]

A grade-school pupil's home do-it-yourself SUT demonstration for a school science fair was constructed and studied in 2012, in a suburban Connecticut setting.<ref>[http://newtownbee.com/news/education/2013/03/07/st-rose-student-creates-solar-updraft-tower/7775 St Rose Student Creates Solar Updraft Tower | The Newtown Bee<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://wtnh.com/2013/02/20/a-model-solar-updraft-tower-power-plant/ | A Model Solar Updraft Tower Power Plant | WTNH.com]</ref>  With a 7-metre stack and 100 square metre collector, this generated a daily average 6.34&nbsp;mW, from a computer fan as a turbine. Insolation and wind were the major factors on variance (range from 0.12 to 21.78&nbsp;mW) in output.

== Efficiency ==
The traditional solar updraft tower has a power conversion rate considerably lower than many other designs in the (high temperature) [[solar thermal]] group of collectors. The low conversion rate is balanced to some extent by the lower cost per square metre of solar collection.<ref name=""Mills""/><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.eere.energy.gov/troughnet/pdfs/status-part1.pdf |title=3.

Model calculations estimate that a 100 MW plant would require a 1,000 m tower and a greenhouse of {{convert|20|km2}}. A 200&nbsp;MW tower with the same tower would require a collector 7 kilometres in diameter (total area of about 38&nbsp;km²).<ref name=""Schlaich"" /> One 200MW power station will provide enough electricity for around 200,000 typical households and will abate over 900,000 tons of greenhouse producing gases from entering the environment annually. The glazed collector area is expected to extract about 0.5 percent, or 5&nbsp;W/m² of 1&nbsp;kW/m², of the solar energy that falls upon it. If a transpired solar collector is used in place of the glazed collector, the efficiency is doubled. Additional efficiency improvements are possible by modifying the turbine and chimney design to increase air speed using a venturi configuration.  Concentrating thermal [[Concentrated solar power|(CSP)]] or photovoltaic [[Concentrated photovoltaics|(CPV)]] solar power plants range between 20% to 31.25% efficiency ([[Dish Stirling#Dish designs|dish Stirling]]). Overall CSP/CPV efficiency is reduced because collectors do not cover the entire footprint. Without further tests, the accuracy of these calculations is uncertain.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.solener.2005.04.001 |id={{INIST|17773321}} |title=Critical evaluation of solar chimney power plant performance |journal=Solar Energy |volume=80 |issue=5 |pages=535–44 |year=2006 |last1=Pretorius |first1=J.P. |last2=Kröger |first2=D.G. |bibcode=2006SoEn...80..535P }}</ref>  Most of the projections of efficiency, costs and yields are calculated theoretically, rather than empirically derived from demonstrations, and are seen in comparison with other collector or solar heat transducing technologies.<ref>{{cite book|last=Norton|first=Brian|title=Harnessing Solar Heat|date=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-007-7274-8}}{{pn|date=June 2017}}</ref>

An innovative concept recombining a thermal power plant dry cooling tower with a solar chimney was first introduced by Zandian and Ashjaee<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.renene.2012.09.051 |title=The thermal efficiency improvement of a steam Rankine cycle by innovative design of a hybrid cooling tower and a solar chimney concept |journal=Renewable Energy |volume=51 |pages=465–473 |year=2013 |last1=Zandian |first1=A |last2=Ashjaee |first2=M }}</ref> in 2013 to increase the efficiency of the solar updraft towers. This hybrid cooling-tower-solar-chimney (HCTSC) system was shown to be able to produce an over ten times increase in output power compared to the conventional solar chimney power plants like [[Manzanares, Ciudad Real]], with similar geometrical dimensions. In addition, it was shown that with an increase in chimney diameter, the power generation can reach to MW-graded power output without the necessity of building huge individual solar chimney panels. The results showed a maximum of 3 MW power output from the HCTSC system which resulted in 0.37% increase in the thermal efficiency of a typical 250 MW fossil fuel power plant, with a chimney diameter of only {{convert|50|m|ft}}. The new hybrid design made the solar updraft tower feasible again, and proved it to be economical in saving lots of construction cost and time. This concept also recaptures the heat of radiators that are thrown out into the atmosphere without efficient utilization, and prevents generation of excessive greenhouse gasses.

The performance of an updraft tower may be degraded by factors such as atmospheric winds,<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1115/HT-FED2004-56651 |chapter=Computing Flow in a Solar Chimney Plant Subject to Atmospheric Winds |title=Volume 2, Parts a and B |pages=1153–62 |year=2004 |last1=Serag-Eldin |first1=M.

===Updraft===

* The [[Vortex engine|atmospheric vortex]] proposal<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vortexengine.ca/index.shtml |title=Atmospheric Vortex Engine |publisher=Vortexengine.ca |accessdate=2011-09-11}}</ref> replaces the physical chimney by a controlled or 'anchored' cyclonic updraft vortex. Depending on the column gradient of temperature and pressure, or buoyancy, and stability of the vortex, very high-altitude updraft may be achievable. As an alternative to a solar collector, industrial and urban waste-heat could be used to initiate and sustain the updraft in the vortex.
* Telescopic or retractable design may lower a very high chimney for maintenance, or to prevent storm damage.  Hot-air balloon chimney suspension has also been proposed.
* A form of [[solar boiler]] technology placed directly above the turbine at the base of the tower might increase the up-draught.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}
* Moreno (2006) teaches in U.S. Patent #7,026,723<ref>https://www.google.com/patents/US7026723</ref> that a chimney can be economically placed on a hill or mountain slope.  Klinkman (2014) in U.S. Patent #8,823,197 <ref>https://www.google.com/patents/US20120153628</ref> elaborates on constructing diagonal chimneys.  A structure as simply built as a high hoop tunnel, but much longer in length and on a slope, can permanently generate an airflow for producing electricity.  Changing the chimney's height differential from 200m (the Manzanares experiment) to 2000m (Charleston Peak in Nevada has a rise of over 2500m, for example) will transfer a factor of ten more of captured solar heat into electric power.  Increasing the temperature differential between chimney air and outside air by a factor of ten increases the same chimney's power by one further factor of ten, assuming that the chimney's walls are engineered to take the extra heat.  Concentrating solar heat is often done with reflection.
*An inflatable solar chimney power plant has been evaluated analytically and simulated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling.

* Fitted with a vortex chimney scrubber, the updraft could be cleaned of particulate air pollution.  Alternately, particulate air pollution caught in the updraft could serve as a nucleation stimulus for precipitation<ref>[[Cloud condensation nuclei]]</ref> either in the chimney, or at release altitude as [[cloud seeds]].
* Energy production, water desalination<ref name=Zhou10/> or simple atmospheric water [[solar cyclone|extraction]] could be used to support carbon-fixing or food-producing local agriculture,<ref>{{cite web|author=Tom Bosschaert |url=http://www.except.nl/consult/SolarUpdraftTower/solar_updraft_research.html |title=Solar Updraft Tower Research: Except Consulting |publisher=Except.nl |date=2008-09-26 |accessdate=2011-09-11}}</ref> and for intensive [[algaculture|aquaculture]] and [[horticulture]] under the solar collector as a greenhouse.
*  A balloon-suspended lightweight extensible chimney anchored from an urban tether, raised from ground level through low warm air to higher altitude could remove low lying air pollution without the need for a broad collector at the base, given adequate height of release.  This might improve air quality in highly polluted megacities without the burden and cost of major fixed construction.

== Capitalisation ==
A solar updraft power station would require a large initial capital outlay, but would have relatively low operating cost.<ref name=""Schlaich""/>

Capital outlays would be roughly the same as next-generation nuclear plants such as the AP-1000 at roughly $5 per Watt of capacity. As with other renewable power sources, towers have no need for fuel. Overall costs are largely determined by interest rates and years of operation, varying from 5 eurocent per kWh for 4% and 20 years to 15 eurocent per kWh for 12% and 40 years.<ref>""The Solar Chimney"" by Jörg Schlaich, 1995</ref>

Estimates of total costs range from 7 (for a 200 MW plant) and 21 (for a 5 MW plant) euro cents per kWh to 25–35 cents per kWh.<ref>{{note|PhysicaPlus}} {{cite journal | last = Zaslavsky | first = Dan | title = Energy Towers | journal = PhysicaPlus — Online magazine of the Israel Physical Society | issue = 7 | publisher = Israel Physical Society | date=  2006 | url = http://physicaplus.org.il/zope/home/en/1124811264/1137833043_en | accessdate = 30 March 2007}}</ref> [[Levelized cost]] are approximately 3 Euro cents per KWh for a 100 MW wind or natural gas plant.<ref>[http://www.energy.ca.gov/electricity/levelized_cost.html Levelized Costs of Electricity Production by Technology] California Energy Commission, 2003</ref> No actual data are available for a utility scale power plant.<ref>{{cite web | last = Groenendaal | first = B.J. | title = Solar Thermal Power Technologies | work = Monograph in the framework of the VLEEM Project | publisher = Energy research Centre of the Netherlands: ECN |date=July 2002 | url = http://www.ecn.nl/docs/library/report/2002/c02062.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 30 March 2007 }}</ref>","== See also ==

27743,2017-08-20 15:56:00-05,Solar energy,"'''Solar energy''' is radiant light and heat from the [[Sun]] that is harnessed using a range of ever-evolving technologies such as [[solar heating]], [[photovoltaics]], [[solar thermal energy]], [[solar architecture]], molten salt power plants and [[artificial photosynthesis]].<ref name=ie11/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/ScienceAndTechnology/Policy/Documents/solar-fuels.asp|title=Energy|work=rsc.org}}</ref>

It is an important source of [[renewable energy]] and its technologies are broadly characterized as either [[passive solar]] or [[active solar]] depending on how they capture and distribute solar energy or convert it into [[solar power]]. Active solar techniques include the use of [[photovoltaic system]]s, [[concentrated solar power]] and [[solar water heating]] to harness the energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable [[thermal mass]] or light-dispersing properties, and designing spaces that [[Ventilation (architecture)|naturally circulate air]].

The large magnitude of solar energy available makes it a highly appealing source of electricity. The [[United Nations Development Programme]] in its 2000 World Energy Assessment found that the annual potential of solar energy was 1,575–49,837 [[Joule#Multiples|exajoules]] (EJ). This is several times larger than the total [[world energy consumption]], which was 559.8&nbsp;EJ in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2014.pdf |title=2014 Key World Energy Statistics |publisher=IEA |website=iea.org |pages=6, 24, 28 |format=PDF |date=2014 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6YIEFsQ6b?url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2014.pdf |archivedate=5 May 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref><ref name=""World Energy Assessment"">{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/dam/aplaws/publication/en/publications/environment-energy/www-ee-library/sustainable-energy/world-energy-assessment-energy-and-the-challenge-of-sustainability/World%20Energy%20Assessment-2000.pdf|title=Energy and the challenge of sustainability|work=United Nations Development Programme and [[World Energy Council]]|date=September 2000|format=PDF|accessdate=17 January 2017}}</ref>

In 2011, the [[International Energy Agency]] said that ""the development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits. It will increase countries’ energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource, enhance [[sustainability]], reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating [[global warming]], and keep [[fossil fuel]] prices lower than otherwise. These advantages are global. Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared"".<ref name=ie11>{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/solar2011SUM.pdf |title=Solar Energy Perspectives: Executive Summary |year=2011 |format=PDF |publisher=International Energy Agency |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/63fIHKr1S?url=http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/solar2011SUM.pdf |archivedate=3 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>

Solar radiation is absorbed by the Earth's land surface, oceans – which cover about 71% of the globe – and atmosphere. Warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises, causing [[atmospheric circulation]] or [[convection]]. When the air reaches a high altitude, where the temperature is low, water vapor condenses into clouds, which rain onto the Earth's surface, completing the [[water cycle]].

The potential solar energy that could be used by humans differs from the amount of solar energy present near the surface of the planet because factors such as geography, time variation, cloud cover, and the land available to humans limit the amount of solar energy that we can acquire.

Geography affects solar energy potential because areas that are closer to the [[equator]] have a greater amount of solar radiation. However, the use of [[photovoltaics]] that can follow the position of the sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the equator.<ref name=""World Energy Assessment""/> Time variation effects the potential of solar energy because during the nighttime there is little solar radiation on the surface of the Earth for [[solar panels]] to absorb. This limits the amount of energy that solar panels can absorb in one day. [[Cloud cover]] can affect the potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the sun and reduce the light available for solar cells.

In addition, land availability has a large effect on the available solar energy because solar panels can only be set up on land that is otherwise unused and suitable for solar panels. Roofs have been found to be a suitable place for solar cells, as many people have discovered that they can collect energy directly from their homes this way. Other areas that are suitable for solar cells are lands that are not being used for businesses where solar plants can be established.<ref name=""World Energy Assessment""/>

Solar technologies are characterized as either passive or active depending on the way they capture, convert and distribute sunlight and enable solar energy to be harnessed at different levels around the world, mostly depending on distance from the equator. Although solar energy refers primarily to the use of solar radiation for practical ends, all renewable energies, other than [[Geothermal power]] and [[Tidal power]], derive their energy either directly or indirectly from the Sun.

Active solar techniques use photovoltaics, [[concentrated solar power]], [[solar thermal collector]]s, pumps, and fans to convert sunlight into useful outputs. Passive solar techniques include selecting materials with favorable thermal properties, designing spaces that naturally circulate air, and referencing the position of a building to the Sun. Active solar technologies increase the supply of energy and are considered [[supply side]] technologies, while passive solar technologies reduce the need for alternate resources and are generally considered demand side technologies.<ref name=""IEA Solar Thermal""/>

In 2000, the [[United Nations Development Programme]], UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, and [[World Energy Council]] published an estimate of the potential solar energy that could be used by humans each year that took into account factors such as insolation, cloud cover, and the land that is usable by humans. The estimate found that solar energy has a global potential of 1,575–49,837&nbsp;EJ per year ''(see table below)''.<ref name=""World Energy Assessment""/>

===Early commercial adaptation===
[[File:US Patent 1240890.pdf|thumb|upright=0.80|1917 Patent drawing of Shuman's solar collector]]
In 1897, [[Frank Shuman]], a U.S. inventor, engineer and solar energy pioneer built a small demonstration solar engine that worked by reflecting solar energy onto square boxes filled with ether, which has a lower boiling point than water, and were fitted internally with black pipes which in turn powered a steam engine. In 1908 Shuman formed the Sun Power Company with the intent of building larger solar power plants. He, along with his technical advisor A.S.E. Ackermann and British physicist Sir [[C. V. Boys|Charles Vernon Boys]],{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes, increasing heating capacity to the extent that water could now be used instead of ether. Shuman then constructed a full-scale steam engine powered by low-pressure water, enabling him to patent the entire solar engine system by 1912.

Shuman built the world's first [[Solar thermal energy|solar thermal power station]] in [[Maadi]], [[Egypt]], between 1912 and 1913. His plant used [[parabolic trough]]s to power a {{convert|45|–|52|kW|hp|lk=out}} engine that pumped more than {{convert|22000|litres}} of water per minute from the [[Nile River]] to adjacent cotton fields. Although the outbreak of World War I and the discovery of [[Petroleum industry|cheap oil]] in the 1930s discouraged the advancement of solar energy, Shuman's vision and basic design were resurrected in the 1970s with a new wave of interest in solar thermal energy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Zachary Alden|author2=Taylor, Katrina D.|title=Renewable And Alternative Energy Resources: A Reference Handbook|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|date=2008|page=174|isbn=978-1-59884-089-6}}</ref> In 1916 Shuman was quoted in the media advocating solar energy's utilization, saying:

[[File:Flipped MIT Solar One house.png|thumb|left|[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]'s Solar House #1, built in 1939 in the U.S., used [[seasonal thermal energy storage]] for year-round heating.]]
Thermal mass is any material that can be used to store heat—heat from the Sun in the case of solar energy. Common thermal mass materials include stone, cement and water. Historically they have been used in arid climates or warm temperate regions to keep buildings cool by absorbing solar energy during the day and radiating stored heat to the cooler atmosphere at night. However, they can be used in cold temperate areas to maintain warmth as well. The size and placement of thermal mass depend on several factors such as climate, daylighting and shading conditions. When properly incorporated, thermal mass maintains space temperatures in a comfortable range and reduces the need for auxiliary heating and cooling equipment.<ref>Mazria (1979), pp. 29–35</ref>

A solar chimney (or thermal chimney, in this context) is a passive solar ventilation system composed of a vertical shaft connecting the interior and exterior of a building. As the chimney warms, the air inside is heated causing an [[updraft]] that pulls air through the building. Performance can be improved by using glazing and thermal mass materials<ref>{{cite web|last=Bright|first=David|date=18 February 1977|title=Passive solar heating simpler for the average owner|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=beAzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UDgHAAAAIBAJ&pg=1418,1115815&dq=improved+by+using+glazing+and+thermal+mass&hl=en|publisher=Bangor Daily News|accessdate=3 July 2011}}</ref> in a way that mimics greenhouses.

[[Deciduous]] trees and plants have been promoted as a means of controlling solar heating and cooling. When planted on the southern side of a building in the northern hemisphere or the northern side in the southern hemisphere, their leaves provide shade during the summer, while the bare limbs allow light to pass during the winter.<ref>Mazria (1979), p. 255</ref> Since bare, leafless trees shade 1/3 to 1/2 of incident solar radiation, there is a balance between the benefits of summer shading and the corresponding loss of winter heating.<ref>Balcomb (1992), p. 56</ref> In climates with significant heating loads, deciduous trees should not be planted on the Equator-facing side of a building because they will interfere with winter solar availability. They can, however, be used on the east and west sides to provide a degree of summer shading without appreciably affecting winter solar gain.<ref>Balcomb (1992), p. 57</ref>

===Cooking===
{{Main article|Solar cooker}}
[[File:Auroville Solar Bowl.JPG|thumb|Parabolic dish produces steam for cooking, in [[Auroville]], India]]
Solar cookers use sunlight for cooking, drying and [[pasteurization]]. They can be grouped into three broad categories: box cookers, panel cookers and reflector cookers.<ref>Anderson and Palkovic (1994), p. xi</ref> The simplest solar cooker is the box cooker first built by [[Horace de Saussure]] in 1767.<ref>Butti and Perlin (1981), pp. 54–59</ref> A basic box cooker consists of an insulated container with a transparent lid. It can be used effectively with partially overcast skies and will typically reach temperatures of {{convert|90-150|C}}.<ref>Anderson and Palkovic (1994), p. xii</ref> Panel cookers use a reflective panel to direct sunlight onto an insulated container and reach temperatures comparable to box cookers. Reflector cookers use various concentrating geometries (dish, trough, Fresnel mirrors) to focus light on a cooking container. These cookers reach temperatures of {{convert|315|C}} and above but require direct light to function properly and must be repositioned to track the Sun.<ref>Anderson and Palkovic (1994), p. xiii</ref>

===Process heat===
{{Main article|Solar pond|Salt evaporation pond|Solar furnace}}
Solar concentrating technologies such as parabolic dish, trough and Scheffler reflectors can provide process heat for commercial and industrial applications. The first commercial system was the [[Solar Total Energy Project]] (STEP) in Shenandoah, Georgia, USA where a field of 114 parabolic dishes provided 50% of the process heating, air conditioning and electrical requirements for a clothing factory. This grid-connected cogeneration system provided 400&nbsp;kW of electricity plus thermal energy in the form of 401&nbsp;kW steam and 468&nbsp;kW chilled water, and had a one-hour peak load thermal storage.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shenandoah Solar Total Energy Project|author1=Stine, W.

===Molten salt technology===

Molten salt can be employed as a thermal energy storage method to retain thermal energy collected by a [[Solar power tower|solar tower]] or [[solar trough]] of a [[concentrated solar power plant]], so that it can be used to generate electricity in bad weather or at night. It was demonstrated in the [[Solar Two]] project from 1995–1999. The system is predicted to have an annual efficiency of 99%, a reference to the energy retained by storing heat before turning it into electricity, versus converting heat directly into electricity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandia.gov/Renewable_Energy/solarthermal/NSTTF/salt.htm |title=Advantages of Using Molten Salt |accessdate=2011-07-14 |last=Mancini |first=Tom |date=10 January 2006 |publisher=Sandia National Laboratories |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/60AE7heEZ?url=http://www.sandia.gov/Renewable_Energy/solarthermal/NSTTF/salt.htm |archivedate=14 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref><ref>[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1977htec.proc...39J Molten salt energy storage system - A feasibility study] Jones, B.

The most extended mixture contains [[sodium nitrate]], [[potassium nitrate]] and [[calcium nitrate]]. It is non-flammable and nontoxic, and has already been used in the chemical and metals industries as a heat-transport fluid, so experience with such systems exists in non-solar applications.

The salt melts at {{convert|131|°C|°F}}. It is kept liquid at {{convert|288|°C|°F}} in an insulated ""cold"" storage tank. The liquid salt is pumped through panels in a solar collector where the focused sun heats it  to {{convert|566|°C|°F}}. It is then sent to a hot storage tank. This is so well insulated that the thermal energy can be usefully stored for up to a week.<ref>Ehrlich, Robert, 2013, ''Renewable Energy: A First Course'', CRC Press, Chap. 13.1.22 ''Thermal storage'' p. 375 {{ISBN|978-1439861158}}</ref>

When electricity is needed, the hot salt is pumped to a conventional steam-generator to produce [[superheated steam]] for a turbine/generator as used in any conventional coal, oil, or nuclear power plant. A 100-megawatt turbine would need a tank about {{convert|9.1|m|ft}} tall and {{convert|24|m|ft}} in diameter to drive it for four hours by this design.

Solar power is the conversion of sunlight into [[electricity]], either directly using [[photovoltaics]] (PV), or indirectly using [[concentrated solar power]] (CSP). CSP systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. PV converts light into electric current using the [[photoelectric effect]].

Solar power is anticipated to become the world's largest source of electricity by 2050, with solar photovoltaics and concentrated solar power contributing 16 and 11 percent to the global overall consumption, respectively.<ref>{{cite web|author=International Energy Agency |website=iea.org |title=Technology Roadmap: Solar Photovoltaic Energy |url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/TechnologyRoadmapSolarPhotovoltaicEnergy_2014edition.pdf |publisher=IEA |accessdate=7 October 2014 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6T92GIRhW?url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/TechnologyRoadmapSolarPhotovoltaicEnergy_2014edition.pdf |archivedate=7 October 2014 |format=PDF |date=2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref>

Commercial CSP plants were first developed in the 1980s. Since 1985 the eventually 354 MW [[Solar Energy Generating Systems|SEGS]] CSP installation, in the Mojave Desert of California, is the largest solar power plant in the world. Other large CSP plants include the 150 MW [[Solnova Solar Power Station]] and the 100 MW [[Andasol solar power station]], both in Spain. The 250 MW<!--AC, approximately 250/.83=300 MW DC--> [[Agua Caliente Solar Project]], in the United States, and the 221 MW<!--DC--> [[Gujarat Solar Park|Charanka Solar Park]] in India, are the [[List of photovoltaic power stations|world's largest]] [[photovoltaic plant]]s. Solar projects exceeding 1 GW are being developed, but most of the deployed photovoltaics are in small rooftop arrays of less than 5&nbsp;kW, which are connected to the grid using net metering and/or a feed-in tariff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.energytoolbox.org/gcre/mod_5/gcre_solar.pdf|format=PDF|title=Grid Connected Renewable Energy: Solar Electric Technologies|publisher=energytoolbox.org}}</ref> In 2013 solar generated less than 1% of the world's total grid electricity.<ref>[http://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/excel/Energy-Economics/statistical-review-2014/BP-Statistical_Review_of_world_energy_2014_workbook.xlsx Historical Data Workbook (2013 calendar year)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140622090917/http://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/excel/Energy-Economics/statistical-review-2014/BP-Statistical_Review_of_world_energy_2014_workbook.xlsx |date=2014-06-22 }}</ref>

In the last two decades, [[photovoltaics]] (PV), also known as solar PV, has evolved from a pure niche market of small scale applications towards becoming a mainstream electricity source. A [[solar cell]] is a device that converts light directly into electricity using the photoelectric effect. The first solar cell was constructed by [[Charles Fritts]] in the 1880s.<ref>Perlin (1999), p. 147</ref> In 1931 a German engineer, Dr Bruno Lange, developed a photo cell using [[silver selenide]] in place of [[copper oxide]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9CcDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA41&dq=Popular+Science+1931+plane#v=onepage&q=Popular%20Science%201931%20plane&f=true|title=""Magic Plates, Tap Sun For Power"", June 1931, Popular Science|accessdate=19 April 2011}}</ref> Although the prototype [[selenium]] cells converted less than 1% of incident light into electricity, both [[Ernst Werner von Siemens]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell]] recognized the importance of this discovery.<ref>Perlin (1999), pp. 18–20</ref> Following the work of [[Russell Ohl]] in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, [[Calvin Fuller]] and Daryl Chapin created the [[crystalline silicon]] solar cell in 1954.<ref>Perlin (1999), p. 29</ref> These early solar cells cost 286&nbsp;USD/watt and reached efficiencies of 4.5–6%.<ref>Perlin (1999), pp. 29–30, 38</ref> By 2012 available efficiencies exceeded 20%, and the maximum efficiency of research photovoltaics was in excess of 40%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jap.aip.org/resource/1/japiau/v110/i3/p031301_s1?isAuthorized=no|title=Will we exceed 50% efficiency in photovoltaics?|author=Antonio Luque|work=aip.org}}</ref>

===Concentrated solar power===
{{See also|Concentrated solar power}}
Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. The concentrated heat is then used as a heat source for a conventional power plant. A wide range of concentrating technologies exists; the most developed are the parabolic trough, the concentrating linear fresnel reflector, the Stirling dish and the solar power tower. Various techniques are used to track the Sun and focus light. In all of these systems a [[working fluid]] is heated by the concentrated sunlight, and is then used for power generation or energy storage.<ref>Martin and Goswami (2005), p. 45</ref>

==Architecture and urban planning==

Sunlight has influenced building design since the beginning of architectural history.<ref name=""Schittich 2003"">Schittich (2003), p. 14</ref> Advanced solar architecture and urban planning methods were first employed by the [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Feng shui#Archaeology|Chinese]], who oriented their buildings toward the south to provide light and warmth.<ref>Butti and Perlin (1981), pp. 4, 159</ref>

The common features of [[passive solar]] architecture are orientation relative to the Sun, compact proportion (a low surface area to volume ratio), selective shading (overhangs) and [[Thermal mass (Building)|thermal mass]].<ref name=""Schittich 2003""/> When these features are tailored to the local climate and environment they can produce well-lit spaces that stay in a comfortable temperature range. [[Socrates]]' Megaron House is a classic example of passive solar design.<ref name=""Schittich 2003""/> The most recent approaches to solar design use computer modeling tying together [[daylighting|solar lighting]], [[solar heating|heating]] and [[solar air conditioning|ventilation]] systems in an integrated [[solar design]] package.<ref>Balcomb (1992)</ref> [[Active solar]] equipment such as pumps, fans and switchable windows can complement passive design and improve system performance.

Urban heat islands (UHI) are metropolitan areas with higher temperatures than that of the surrounding environment. The higher temperatures result from increased absorption of solar energy by urban materials such as asphalt and concrete, which have lower [[albedo]]s and higher [[heat capacity|heat capacities]] than those in the natural environment. A straightforward method of counteracting the UHI effect is to paint buildings and roads white, and to plant trees in the area. Using these methods, a hypothetical ""cool communities"" program in Los Angeles has projected that urban temperatures could be reduced by approximately 3&nbsp;°C at an estimated cost of US$1&nbsp;billion, giving estimated total annual benefits of US$530&nbsp;million from reduced air-conditioning costs and healthcare savings.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rosenfeld, Arthur |author2=et. al. |title=Painting the Town White -- and Green |publisher=Heat Island Group |url=http://eetd.lbl.gov/HeatIsland/PUBS/PAINTING/ |accessdate=29 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714173907/http://eetd.lbl.gov/HeatIsland/PUBS/PAINTING/ |archivedate=14 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>

==Agriculture and horticulture==
[[File:Westland kassen.jpg|thumb|[[Greenhouses]] like these in the Westland municipality of the Netherlands grow vegetables, fruits and flowers.]]
[[Agriculture]] and [[horticulture]] seek to optimize the capture of solar energy in order to optimize the productivity of plants. Techniques such as timed planting cycles, tailored row orientation, staggered heights between rows and the mixing of plant varieties can improve crop yields.<ref>{{cite web|title=Row Spacing, Plant Population, and Yield Relationships|author=Jeffrey C. Silvertooth|publisher=University of Arizona|url=http://ag.arizona.edu/crop/cotton/comments/april1999cc.html|accessdate=24 June 2008}}</ref><ref>Kaul (2005), pp. 169–174</ref> While sunlight is generally considered a plentiful resource, the exceptions highlight the importance of solar energy to agriculture. During the short growing seasons of the [[Little Ice Age]], French and [[Solar power in the United Kingdom|English]] farmers employed fruit walls to maximize the collection of solar energy. These walls acted as thermal masses and accelerated ripening by keeping plants warm. Early fruit walls were built perpendicular to the ground and facing south, but over time, sloping walls were developed to make better use of sunlight. In 1699, [[Nicolas Fatio de Duillier]] even suggested using a [[Solar tracker|tracking mechanism]] which could pivot to follow the Sun.<ref>Butti and Perlin (1981), pp. 42–46</ref> Applications of solar energy in agriculture aside from growing crops include pumping water, drying crops, brooding chicks and drying chicken manure.<ref name=""Leon 2006"">Leon (2006), p. 62</ref><ref>Bénard (1981), p. 347</ref> More recently the technology has been embraced by [[Winemakers|vintners]], who use the energy generated by solar panels to power grape presses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novusvinum.com/news/latest_news.html#gonzales|title=A Powerhouse Winery|accessdate=5 November 2008|work=News Update|publisher=Novus Vinum|date=27 October 2008}}</ref>

[[Greenhouse]]s convert solar light to heat, enabling year-round production and the growth (in enclosed environments) of specialty crops and other plants not naturally suited to the local climate. Primitive greenhouses were first used during Roman times to produce [[cucumbers]] year-round for the Roman emperor [[Tiberius]].<ref>Butti and Perlin (1981), p. 19</ref> The first modern greenhouses were built in Europe in the 16th century to keep exotic plants brought back from explorations abroad.<ref>Butti and Perlin (1981), p. 41</ref> Greenhouses remain an important part of horticulture today, and plastic transparent materials have also been used to similar effect in [[polytunnel]]s and [[row cover]]s.

A [[solar balloon]] is a black balloon that is filled with ordinary air. As sunlight shines on the balloon, the air inside is heated and expands causing an upward [[buoyancy]] force, much like an artificially heated [[hot air balloon]]. Some solar balloons are large enough for human flight, but usage is generally limited to the toy market as the surface-area to payload-weight ratio is relatively high.<ref>{{cite web|title=Phenomena which affect a solar balloon|publisher=pagesperso-orange.fr|url=http://pagesperso-orange.fr/ballonsolaire/en-theorie1.htm|accessdate=19 August 2008}}</ref>

==Fuel production==
[[File:Photo of the Week- Boosting Solar Technology (8722948189).jpg|thumb|Concentrated solar panels are getting a power boost. [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]] (PNNL) will be testing a new concentrated solar power system -- one that can help natural gas power plants reduce their fuel usage by up to 20 percent.]]
{{Main article|Solar chemical|Solar fuel|Artificial photosynthesis}}
Solar chemical processes use solar energy to drive chemical reactions. These processes offset energy that would otherwise come from a fossil fuel source and can also convert solar energy into storable and transportable fuels. Solar induced chemical reactions can be divided into thermochemical or [[photochemical]].<ref>Bolton (1977), p. 1</ref> A variety of fuels can be produced by [[artificial photosynthesis]].<ref>Wasielewski M. R. Photoinduced electron transfer in supramolecular systems for artificial photosynthesis. Chem. Rev. 1992; 92: 435-461.</ref> The multielectron catalytic chemistry involved in making carbon-based fuels (such as [[methanol]]) from reduction of [[carbon dioxide]] is challenging; a feasible alternative is [[hydrogen]] production from protons, though use of water as the source of electrons (as plants do) requires mastering the multielectron oxidation of two water molecules to molecular oxygen.<ref>Hammarstrom L. and Hammes-Schiffer S. Artificial Photosynthesis and Solar Fuels. Accounts of Chemical Research 2009; 42 (12): 1859–1860.</ref> Some have envisaged working solar fuel plants in coastal metropolitan areas by 2050{{snd}} the splitting of sea water providing hydrogen to be run through adjacent fuel-cell electric power plants and the pure water by-product going directly into the municipal water system.<ref>Gray H. B. Powering the planet with solar fuel. Nature Chemistry 2009; 1: 7.</ref> Another vision involves all human structures covering the earth's surface (i.e., roads, vehicles and buildings) doing photosynthesis more efficiently than plants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2013/EE/C3EE40534F|title=Artificial photosynthesis as a frontier technology for energy sustainability – Energy & Environmental Science (RSC Publishing)|work=rsc.org}}</ref>

[[Hydrogen production]] technologies have been a significant area of solar chemical research since the 1970s. Aside from electrolysis driven by photovoltaic or photochemical cells, several thermochemical processes have also been explored. One such route uses concentrators to split water into oxygen and hydrogen at high temperatures ({{convert|2300|-|2600|C|disp=or|sigfig=2}}).<ref>Agrafiotis (2005), p. 409</ref> Another approach uses the heat from solar concentrators to drive the [[steam reforming|steam reformation]] of natural gas thereby increasing the overall hydrogen yield compared to conventional reforming methods.<ref>Zedtwitz (2006), p. 1333</ref> Thermochemical cycles characterized by the decomposition and regeneration of reactants present another avenue for hydrogen production. The Solzinc process under development at the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] uses a 1&nbsp;MW solar furnace to decompose [[zinc oxide]] (ZnO) at temperatures above {{convert|1200|C|sigfig=2}}. This initial reaction produces pure zinc, which can subsequently be reacted with water to produce hydrogen.<ref>{{cite web|title=Solar Energy Project at the Weizmann Institute Promises to Advance the use of Hydrogen Fuel|publisher=Weizmann Institute of Science|url=http://wis-wander.weizmann.ac.il/site/en/weizman.asp?pi=371&doc_id=4210|accessdate=25 June 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406124059/http://wis-wander.weizmann.ac.il/site/en/weizman.asp?pi=371&doc_id=4210|archivedate=6 April 2008|df=}}</ref>

==Energy storage methods==
{{Main article|Energy storage|Seasonal thermal energy storage|Phase change material|Grid energy storage|V2G}}
[[File:12-05-08 AS1.JPG|thumb|[[Thermal energy storage]]. The [[Andasol solar power station|Andasol]] CSP plant uses tanks of molten salt to store solar energy.]]
[[Thermal mass]] systems can store solar energy in the form of heat at domestically useful temperatures for daily or [[seasonal thermal energy storage|interseasonal durations]]. Thermal storage systems generally use readily available materials with high [[specific heat]] capacities such as water, earth and stone. Well-designed systems can lower [[peak demand]], shift time-of-use to [[wikt:off-peak|off-peak]] hours and reduce overall heating and cooling requirements.<ref>Balcomb(1992), p. 6</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Request for Participation Summer 2005 Demand Shifting with Thermal Mass|publisher=Demand Response Research Center|url=http://www.drrc.lbl.gov/pubs/RFP_071405.pdf|accessdate=26 November 2007|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907214724/http://drrc.lbl.gov/pubs/RFP_071405.pdf|archivedate=7 September 2008|df=}}</ref>

Phase change materials such as [[paraffin wax]] and [[Sodium sulfate#Thermal storage|Glauber's salt]] are another thermal storage medium. These materials are inexpensive, readily available, and can deliver domestically useful temperatures (approximately {{convert|64|C|disp=or}}). The ""Dover House"" (in [[Dover, Massachusetts]]) was the first to use a Glauber's salt heating system, in 1948.<ref>Butti and Perlin (1981), pp. 212–214</ref> Solar energy can also be stored at high temperatures using [[molten salt]]s. Salts are an effective storage medium because they are low-cost, have a high specific heat capacity and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems. The [[The Solar Project#Solar Two|Solar Two]] project used this method of energy storage, allowing it to store {{convert|1.44|TJ|lk=in}} in its 68 m³ storage tank with an annual storage efficiency of about 99%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Advantages of Using Molten Salt|publisher=Sandia National Laboratory|url=http://www.sandia.gov/Renewable_Energy/solarthermal/NSTTF/salt.htm|accessdate=29 September 2007}}</ref>

Off-grid [[Photovoltaics|PV systems]] have traditionally used [[rechargeable batteries]] to store excess electricity. With grid-tied systems, excess electricity can be sent to the transmission [[Grid-tied electrical system|grid]], while standard grid electricity can be used to meet shortfalls. [[Net metering]] programs give household systems a credit for any electricity they deliver to the grid. This is handled by 'rolling back' the meter whenever the home produces more electricity than it consumes. If the net electricity use is below zero, the utility then rolls over the kilowatt hour credit to the next month.<ref>{{cite web|title=PV Systems and Net Metering |publisher=Department of Energy |url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/net_metering.html |accessdate=31 July 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704062311/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/net_metering.html |archivedate=4 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> Other approaches involve the use of two meters, to measure electricity consumed vs. electricity produced. This is less common due to the increased installation cost of the second meter. Most standard meters accurately measure in both directions, making a second meter unnecessary.

[[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] stores energy in the form of water pumped when energy is available from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation one. The energy is recovered when demand is high by releasing the water, with the pump becoming a hydroelectric power generator.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pumped Hydro Storage |publisher=Electricity Storage Association |url=http://www.electricitystorage.org/tech/technologies_technologies_pumpedhydro.htm |accessdate=31 July 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621052054/http://www.electricitystorage.org/tech/technologies_technologies_pumpedhydro.htm |archivedate=21 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>

==Development, deployment and economics==
[[File:03242012Taller sostenibilidad lore060.jpg|thumb|Participants in a workshop on sustainable development inspect solar panels at [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Mexico City]] on top of a building on campus.]]
{{Main article|Deployment of solar power to energy grids}}{{See also|Cost of electricity by source|Renewable energy by country}}
Beginning with the surge in [[coal]] use which accompanied the [[Industrial Revolution]], energy consumption has steadily transitioned from wood and biomass to [[fossil fuel]]s. The early development of solar technologies starting in the 1860s was driven by an expectation that coal would soon become scarce. However, development of solar technologies stagnated in the early 20th&nbsp;century in the face of the increasing availability, economy, and utility of coal and [[petroleum]].<ref>Butti and Perlin (1981), pp. 63, 77, 101</ref>

The [[1973 oil crisis|1973 oil embargo]] and [[1979 energy crisis]] caused a reorganization of energy policies around the world and brought renewed attention to developing solar technologies.<ref>Butti and Perlin (1981), p. 249</ref><ref>Yergin (1991), pp. 634, 653-673</ref> Deployment strategies focused on incentive programs such as the Federal Photovoltaic Utilization Program in the U.S. and the Sunshine Program in Japan. Other efforts included the formation of research facilities in the U.S. (SERI, now [[NREL]]), Japan ([[New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization|NEDO]]), and [[Solar power in Germany|Germany]] ([[Fraunhofer Society|Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Chronicle of Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft|publisher=Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft|url=http://www.fraunhofer.de/EN/company/profile/chronicle/1972-1982.jsp|accessdate=4 November 2007}}</ref>

Commercial solar water heaters began appearing in the United States in the 1890s.<ref>Butti and Perlin (1981), p. 117</ref> These systems saw increasing use until the 1920s but were gradually replaced by cheaper and more reliable heating fuels.<ref>Butti and Perlin (1981), p. 139</ref> As with photovoltaics, [[solar water heating]] attracted renewed attention as a result of the oil crises in the 1970s but interest subsided in the 1980s due to falling petroleum prices. Development in the solar water heating sector progressed steadily throughout the 1990s and annual growth rates have averaged 20% since 1999.<ref name=""SWH 2008"">{{cite web|title=Solar Heat Worldwide - Markets and Contribution to the Energy Supply 2006|author=Weiss, Werner|author2=Bergmann, Irene|author3=Faninger, Gerhard|publisher=International Energy Agency|url=http://www.iea-shc.org/publications/statistics/IEA-SHC_Solar_Heat_Worldwide-2008.pdf|accessdate=9 June 2008|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910052052/http://www.iea-shc.org/publications/statistics/IEA-SHC_Solar_Heat_Worldwide-2008.pdf|archivedate=10 September 2008}}</ref> Although generally underestimated, solar water heating and cooling is by far the most widely deployed solar technology with an estimated capacity of 154&nbsp;GW as of 2007.<ref name=""SWH 2008""/>

The [[International Energy Agency]] has said that solar energy can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent problems the world now faces:<ref name=ie11/>
<blockquote>
The development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits. It will increase countries’ energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource, enhance sustainability, reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating climate change, and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise. These advantages are global. Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared.<ref name=ie11/>
</blockquote>

In 2011, a report by the [[International Energy Agency]] found that solar energy technologies such as photovoltaics, solar hot water and concentrated solar power could provide a third of the world's energy by 2060 if politicians commit to limiting [[climate change]]. The energy from the sun could play a key role in de-carbonizing the global economy alongside improvements in [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and imposing costs on [[greenhouse gas]] emitters. ""The strength of solar is the incredible variety and flexibility of applications, from small scale to big scale"".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-01/iea-says-solar-may-provide-a-third-of-global-energy-by-2060.html|title=IEA Says Solar May Provide a Third of Global Energy by 2060|date=1 December 2011|work=Bloomberg Businessweek}}</ref>

==ISO standards==
The [[International Organization for Standardization]] has established several standards relating to solar energy equipment. For example, ISO 9050 relates to glass in building while ISO 10217 relates to the materials used in solar water heaters.","==See also==

533423,2017-08-28 00:52:00-05,Solar water heating,"'''Solar water heating''' (SWH) is the conversion of [[sunlight]] into heat for [[water heating]] using a [[solar thermal collector]]. A variety of configurations are available at varying cost to provide solutions in different climates and latitudes. SWHs are widely used for residential and some industrial applications.<ref name=""C. Marken 2009"" />

A sun-facing collector heats a [[working fluid]] that passes into a storage system for later use. SWH are active (pumped) and passive ([[Natural convection|convection]]-driven). They use water only, or both water and a working fluid. They are heated directly or via light-concentrating mirrors. They operate independently or as hybrids with electric or gas heaters.<ref>Brian Norton (2011) Solar Water Heaters: A Review of Systems Research and Design Innovation, Green. 1, 189–207, ISSN (Online) 1869-8778</ref> In large-scale installations, mirrors may concentrate sunlight onto a smaller collector.

The global solar thermal market is dominated by China, Europe, Japan and [[Solar power in India|India]], although Israel was one of the first countries to mandate installation of SWH in 1980, leading to a flourishing industry.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Wei|last2=Rubin|first2=Tzameret H.|last3=Onyina|first3=Paul A.|date=2013-05-01|title=Comparing Solar Water Heater Popularization Policies in China, Israel and Australia: The Roles of Governments in Adopting Green Innovations|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sd.1547/abstract|journal=Sustainable Development|language=en|volume=21|issue=3|pages=160–170|doi=10.1002/sd.1547|issn=1099-1719}}</ref>

In 1896 Clarence Kemp of Baltimore enclosed a tank in a wooden box, thus creating the first 'batch water heater' as they are known today. [[Frank Shuman]] built the world’s first solar thermal power station in [[Maadi, Egypt]], using parabolic troughs to power a 60-70 horsepower engine that pumped 6,000 gallons of water per minute from the [[Nile|Nile River]] to adjacent cotton fields.

Flat-plate collectors for solar water heating were used in Florida and Southern California in the 1920s. Interest grew in North America after 1960, but especially after the [[1973 oil crisis]].

Solar water heating systems are popular in China, where basic models start at around 1,500 [[Renminbi|yuan]] (US$235), around 80% less than in Western countries for a given collector size. At least 30 million Chinese households have one. The popularity is due to efficient evacuated tubes that allow the heaters to function even under gray skies and at temperatures well below freezing.<ref>[http://www.planetark.org/dailynewsstory.cfm?newsid=36636 Energy-Hungry China Warms to Solar Water Heaters] discusses [[China Himin Solar Energy Group]] in [[Dezhou]]. Reuters article, posted on [[Planet Ark]] site</ref>

===Latin America===
Colombia developed a local solar water heating industry thanks to the designs of [[Gaviotas|Las Gaviotas]], directed by Paolo Lugari. Driven by a desire to reduce costs in social housing, the team studied the best systems from Israel and made adaptations to meet the specifications set by Banco Central Hipotecario (BCH) which required the system to operate in cities such as Bogotá that are overcast for more than 200 days annually. The ultimate designs were so successful that Las Gaviotas offered a 25-year warranty on its installations in 1984. Over 40,000 were installed and still function a quarter of a century later.

==Design requirements==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2016}}

The type, complexity and size of a solar water heating system is mostly determined by:

* Changes in ambient temperature and solar radiation between summer and winter
* Changes in ambient temperature during the day-night cycle
* Possibility of the potable water or collector fluid overheating or freezing

The minimum requirements of the system are typically determined by the amount or temperature of hot water required during winter, when a system's output and incoming water temperature are typically at their lowest. The maximum output of the system is determined by the need to prevent the water in the system from becoming too hot.

===Freeze protection===

Freeze protection measures prevent damage to the system due to the expansion of freezing transfer fluid. Drainback systems drain the transfer fluid from the system when the pump stops. Many indirect systems use [[antifreeze]] (e.g., [[propylene glycol]]) in the heat transfer fluid.

In some direct systems, collectors can be manually drained when freezing is expected. This approach is common in climates where freezing temperatures do not occur often, but is somewhat unreliable since it relies on an operator.

A third type of freeze protection is freeze-tolerance, where low pressure polymer water channels made of silicone rubber simply expand on freezing. One such collector now has European Solar Keymark accreditation.

===Overheat protection===

When no hot water has been used for a day or two, the fluid in the collectors and storage can reach high temperatures in all non-drainback systems. When the storage tank in a drainback system reaches its desired temperature, the pumps stop, ending the heating process and thus preventing the storage tank from overheating.

Some active systems deliberately cool the water in the storage tank by circulating hot water through the collector at times when there is little sunlight or at night, losing heat. This is most effective in direct or thermal store plumbing and is virtually ineffective in systems that use evacuated tube collectors, due to their superior insulation. Any collector type may still overheat. High pressure, sealed solar thermal systems ultimately rely on the operation of [[Safety valve#Water heaters|temperature and pressure relief valves]]. Low pressure, open vented heaters have simpler, more reliable safety controls, typically an open vent.

==Systems==
Sample designs include a simple glass-topped insulated box with a flat solar absorber made of sheet metal, attached to [[Copper in heat exchangers|copper heat exchanger pipes]] and dark-colored, or a set of metal tubes surrounded by an evacuated (near vacuum) glass cylinder. In industrial cases a [[Parabolic reflector|parabolic mirror]] can concentrate sunlight on the tube. Heat is stored in a [[hot water storage tank]]. The volume of this tank needs to be larger with solar heating systems to compensate for bad weather{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} and because the optimum final temperature for the solar collector{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} is lower than a typical immersion or combustion heater. The heat transfer fluid (HTF) for the absorber may be  water, but more commonly (at least in active systems) is a separate loop of fluid containing [[anti-freeze]] and a [[corrosion inhibitor]] delivers heat to the tank through a [[heat exchanger]] (commonly a coil of [[Copper in heat exchangers|copper heat exchanger tubing]] within the tank). [[Copper in renewable energy#Solar water heaters (solar domestic hot water systems)|Copper is an important component in solar thermal heating and cooling systems]] because of its high heat conductivity, atmospheric and water corrosion resistance, sealing and joining by soldering and mechanical strength. Copper is used both in receivers and primary circuits (pipes and heat exchangers for water tanks).<ref>2011 global status report by Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century (REN21)</ref>

Another lower-maintenance concept is the 'drain-back'. No anti-freeze is required; instead, all the piping is sloped to cause water to drain back to the tank. The tank is not pressurized and operates at atmospheric pressure. As soon as the pump shuts off, flow reverses and the pipes empty before freezing can occur.

[[File:Solar Hot Water Diagram.png|thumb|How a Solar Hot Water system works]]Residential solar thermal installations fall into two groups: passive (sometimes called ""compact"") and active (sometimes called ""pumped"") systems. Both typically include an auxiliary energy source (electric heating element or connection to a gas or fuel oil central heating system) that is activated when the water in the tank falls below a minimum temperature setting, ensuring that hot water is always available. The combination of solar water heating and back-up heat from a wood stove chimney<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.woodheat.org/heating-water-with-a-wood-stove.html|title=Heating water with a wood stove|date=|publisher=Wood Heat Organization Inc.|last1=Gulland|first1=John|work=woodheat.org|accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref> can enable a hot water system to work all year round in cooler climates, without the supplemental heat requirement of a solar water heating system being met with fossil fuels or electricity.

When a solar water heating and hot-water central heating system are used together, solar heat will either be concentrated in a pre-heating tank that feeds into the tank heated by the [[central heating]], or the solar heat exchanger will replace the lower heating element and the upper element will remain to provide for supplemental heat. However, the primary need for central heating is at night and in winter when solar gain is lower. Therefore, solar water heating for washing and bathing is often a better application than central heating because supply and demand are better matched. In many climates, a solar hot water system can provide up to 85% of domestic hot water energy. This can include domestic non-electric [[concentrating solar thermal]] systems. In many northern European countries, combined hot water and space heating systems ([[solar combisystem]]s) are used to provide 15 to 25% of home heating energy. When combined with [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|storage]], large scale solar heating can provide 50-97% of annual heat consumption for [[district heating]].<ref name=""drake1"">{{Citation|last=Wong|first=Bill|title=Drake Landing Solar Community|date=June 28, 2011|series=IDEA/CDEA District Energy/CHP 2011 Conference, Toronto|pages=1–30|contribution=Drake Landing Solar Community|contribution-url=http://www.districtenergy.org/assets/pdfs/2011Annual_Conf/Proceedings/A24WONG-v03.pdf|accessdate=21 April 2013}}</ref><ref name=""ing2015-06-14"">{{cite web|url=http://ing.dk/artikel/verdens-stoerste-damvarmelager-indviet-i-vojens-176776|title=Verdens største damvarmelager indviet i Vojens|date=14 June 2015|first1=Sanne|last1=Wittrup|work=[[Ingeniøren]]}}</ref>

===Heat transfer===

====Direct====
[[Image:DirectSolarSystems.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4| Direct systems: (A) Passive CHS system with tank above collector. (B) Active system with pump and controller driven by a photovoltaic panel.]]

''Direct'' or ''open loop'' systems circulate potable water through the collectors. They are relatively cheap. Drawbacks include:
* They offer little or no overheat protection unless they have a heat export pump.
* They offer little or no freeze protection, unless the collectors are freeze-tolerant.
* Collectors accumulate [[Fouling|scale]] in hard water areas, unless an ion-exchange softener is used.

The advent of freeze-tolerant designs expanded the market for SWH to colder climates. In freezing conditions, earlier models were damaged when the water turned to ice, rupturing one or more components.

====Indirect====
''Indirect'' or ''closed loop'' systems use a heat exchanger to transfer heat from the ""heat-transfer fluid"" (HTF) fluid to the potable water. The most common HTF is an antifreeze/water mix that typically uses non-toxic [[propylene glycol]]. After heating in the panels, the HTF travels to the heat exchanger, where its heat is transferred to the potable water. Indirect systems offer freeze protection and typically overheat protection.

===Propulsion===

====Passive====

''Passive'' systems rely on heat-driven convection or heat pipes to circulate the working fluid. Passive systems cost less and require low or no maintenance, but are less efficient. Overheating and freezing are major concerns.

====Active====
''Active'' systems use one or more pumps to circulate water and/or heating fluid''.'' This permits a much wider range of system configurations.

Pumped systems are more expensive to purchase and to operate. However, they operate at higher efficiency can be more easily controlled.

Active systems have controllers with features such as interaction with a backup electric or gas-driven water heater, calculation and logging of the energy saved, safety functions, remote access and informative displays.

===Passive direct systems===
[[Image:Batch solar thermal collectorColour.jpg|thumb|An integrated collector storage (ICS) system]]

An ''integrated collector storage'' (ICS or Batch Heater) system uses a tank that acts as both storage and collector. Batch heaters are thin rectilinear tanks with a glass side facing the sun at [[Solar noon|noon]]. They are simple and less costly than plate and tube collectors, but they may require bracing if installed on a roof (to support {{convert|400|-|700|lb|kg|abbr=on}}&nbsp;lbs of water), suffer from significant heat loss at night since the side facing the sun is largely uninsulated and are only suitable in moderate climates.

A ''convection heat storage unit'' (CHS) system is similar to an ICS system, except the storage tank and collector are physically separated and transfer between the two is driven by convection. CHS systems typically use standard flat-plate type or evacuated tube collectors. The storage tank must be located above the collectors for convection to work properly. The main benefit of CHS systems over ICS systems is that heat loss is largely avoided since the storage tank can be fully insulated. Since the panels are located below the storage tank, heat loss does not cause convection, as the cold water stays at the lowest part of the system.

===Active indirect systems===

''Pressurized antifreeze'' systems use a mix of [[antifreeze]] (almost always non-toxic propylene glycol) and water mix for HTF in order to prevent freeze damage.

Though effective at preventing freeze damage, antifreeze systems have drawbacks:
* If the HTF gets too hot the glycol degrades into acid and then provides no freeze protection and begins to dissolve the solar loop's components.
* Systems without drainback tanks must circulate the HTF – regardless of the temperature of the storage tank – to prevent the HTF from degrading. Excessive temperatures in the tank cause increased scale and sediment build-up, possible severe burns if a tempering valve is not installed, and if used for storage, possible thermostat failure.
* The glycol/water HTF must be replaced every 3–8 years, depending on the temperatures it has experienced.
* Some jurisdictions require more-expensive, double-walled heat exchangers even though propylene glycol is non-toxic.
* Even though the HTF contains glycol to prevent freezing, it circulates hot water from the storage tank into the collectors at low temperatures (e.g. below {{convert|40|F|C}}), causing substantial heat loss.

A ''drainback system'' is an active indirect system where the HTF (usually pure water) circulates through the collector, driven by a pump. The collector piping is not pressurized and includes an open drainback reservoir that is contained in conditioned or semi-conditioned space. The HTF remains in the drainback reseervoir unless the pump is operating and returns there (emptying the collector) when the pump is switched off. The collector system, including piping, must drain via gravity into the drainback tank. Drainback systems are not subject to freezing or overheating. The pump operates only when appropriate for heat collection, but not to protect the HTF, increasing efficiency and reducing pumping costs.<ref name=""Lane&Olson"">{{cite journal|author1=Lane, T.  |author2=Olson, K.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2002|title= Solar hot water for cold climates: Part II – Drainback systems|journal=Homepower Magazine|volume=86|pages=62–70}}</ref>

==Components==

===Collector===
{{Main article|Solar thermal collector}}
Solar thermal collectors capture and retain heat from the sun and use it to heat a liquid.<ref>{{cite book|last=Norton|first=Brian|title=Harnessing Solar Heat|year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-007-7275-5|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=3hLHBAAAQBAJ}}}}</ref> Two important physical principles govern the technology of solar thermal collectors:
* Any hot object ultimately returns to thermal equilibrium with its environment, due to heat loss from [[Thermal conduction|conduction]], [[convection]] and radiation.<ref name=""W.M. Rohsenow, J.P. Harnett 1998"">W.M. Rohsenow, J.P. Harnett, Y.I. Cho (1998). ''Handbook of heat transfer 3rd Ed.''. McGraw-Hill, Chicago, USA.</ref> Efficiency (the proportion of heat energy retained for a predefined time period) is directly related to heat loss from the collector surface. Convection and radiation are the most important sources of heat loss. Thermal insulation is used to slow heat loss from a hot object. This follows  the [[Second law of thermodynamics]] (the 'equilibrium effect').
* Heat is lost more rapidly if the temperature difference between a hot object and its environment is larger. Heat loss is predominantly governed by the thermal gradient between the collector surface and the ambient temperatures. Conduction, convection and radiation all occur more rapidly over large thermal gradients<ref name=""W.M. Rohsenow, J.P. Harnett 1998"" /> (the delta-''t'' effect).

[[File:Flatplate.png|thumb|Flat-plate solar thermal collector, viewed from roof-level]]

====Flat plate====
Flat plate collectors are an extension of the idea to place a collector in an 'oven'-like box with glass directly facing the Sun.<ref name=""C. Marken 2009"" /> Most flat plate collectors have two horizontal pipes at the top and bottom, called headers, and many smaller vertical pipes connecting them, called risers. The risers are welded (or similarly connected) to thin absorber fins. Heat-transfer fluid (water or water/antifreeze mix) is pumped from the hot water storage tank or heat exchanger into the collectors' bottom header, and it travels up the risers, collecting heat from the absorber fins, and then exits the collector out of the top header. Serpentine flat plate collectors differ slightly from this ""harp"" design, and instead use a single pipe that travels up and down the collector. However, since they cannot be properly drained of water, serpentine flat plate collectors cannot be used in drainback systems.

The type of glass used in flat plate collectors is almost always low-iron, [[Toughened glass|tempered glass]]. Such glass can withstand significant hail without breaking, which is one of the reasons that flat-plate collectors are considered the most durable collector type.

Unglazed or formed collectors are similar to flat-plate collectors, except they are not thermally insulated nor physically protected by a glass panel. Consequently, these types of collectors are much less efficient. For pool heating applications, the water to be heated is often colder than the ambient roof temperature, at which point the lack of thermal insulation allows additional heat to be drawn from the surrounding environment.<ref name=""LanePt1"">{{cite journal|year=2003|title=Solar pool heating basics, Part 1|journal=HomePower|volume=94|pages=70–77|author=D. Lane}}</ref>

====Evacuated tube====
[[File:Sistema por Hidroneumatico (Calentador solar para alta presión).JPG|thumb|Evacuated tube solar water heater on a roof]]
Evacuated tube collectors (ETC) are a way to reduce the heat loss,<ref name=""C. Marken 2009"" /> inherent in flat plates. Since heat loss due to convection cannot cross a vacuum, it forms an efficient isolation mechanism to keep heat inside the collector pipes.<ref>{{cite journal|year=2007|title=Thermal performances comparisons of the glass evacuated tube solar collectors with shapes of absorber tube|journal=Renewable Energy|volume=32|issue=5|pages=772|doi=10.1016/j.renene.2006.03.016|author1=Yong Kim|author2=Taebeom Seo}}</ref> Since two flat glass sheets are generally not strong enough to withstand a vacuum, the vacuum is created between two concentric tubes. Typically, the water piping in an ETC is therefore surrounded by two concentric tubes of glass separated by a vacuum that admits heat from the sun (to heat the pipe) but that limits heat loss. The inner tube is coated with a thermal absorber.<ref>{{cite journal|year=1999|title=Selective absorbing surface for evacuated solar collector tubes|journal=Renewable Energy|volume=16|pages=632|doi=10.1016/S0960-1481(98)00240-7|author1=Shi Yueyan|author2=Yang Xiaoji}}</ref>  Vacuum life varies from collector to collector, from 5 years to 15 years.

Flat plate collectors are generally more efficient than ETC in full sunshine conditions. However, the energy output of flat plate collectors is reduced slightly more than ETCs in cloudy or extremely cold conditions.<ref name=""C. Marken 2009"" />  Most ETCs are made out of annealed glass, which is susceptible to [[hail]], failing given roughly golf ball -sized particles. ETCs made from ""coke glass,"" which has a green tint, are stronger and less likely to lose their vacuum, but efficiency is slightly reduced due to reduced transparency. ETCs can gather energy from the sun all day long at low angles due to their tubular shape.<ref>{{cite journal|last2=Saidur|first2=R.|last3=Mekhilef|first3=Saad|last4=Mahian|first4=Omid|date=1 November 2015|title=Progress and latest developments of evacuated tube solar collectors|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032115006632|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|publisher=|volume=51|pages=1038–1054|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2015.07.016|via=ScienceDirect|first1=M. A.|last1=Sabiha}}</ref>

===Pump ===

====PV pump====
One way to power an active system is via a [[photovoltaic]] (PV) [[PV module|panel]]. To ensure proper pump performance and longevity, the (DC) pump and PV panel must be suitably matched. Although a PV-powered pump does not operate at night, the controller must ensure that the pump does not operate when the sun is out but the collector water is not hot enough.

PV pumps offer the following advantages:
* Simpler/cheaper installation and maintenance
* Excess PV output can be used for household electricity use or put back into the grid.
* Can dehumidify living space.<ref>[http://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/blogs/dept/guest-blogs/getting-hot-water-part-1 Getting into Hot Water — Part 1 - Marc Rosenbaum]</ref>
* Can operate during a power outage.
* Avoids the carbon consumption from using grid-powered pumps.

====Bubble pump====
[[File:Bubble pump.ogv|thumb|The bubble separator of a bubble-pump system]]
A bubble pump (also known as geyser pump) is suitable for flat panel as well as vacuum tube systems. In a bubble pump system, the closed HTF circuit is under reduced pressure, which causes the liquid to boil at low temperature as the sun heats it. The steam bubbles form a geyser, causing an upward flow. The bubbles are separated from the hot fluid and condensed at the highest point in the circuit, after which the fluid flows downward toward the heat exchanger caused by the difference in fluid levels.<ref>A van Houten (Sunnovations), [http://www.sunnovations.com/content/how-sunnovations-system-works How a Geyser Pump works]</ref><ref>Wilfried C. Sorensen (1985) [http://www.google.com/patents?id=pjkyAAAAEBAJ Autogeneous solar water heater], US Patent 4607688.</ref><ref>[http://www.bubbleactionpumps.com/overview/pumpovr1.htm Bubble pump description] at bubbleactionpumps.com</ref> The HTF typically arrives at the heat exchanger at 70&nbsp;°C and returns to the circulating pump at 50&nbsp;°C. Pumping typically starts at about 50&nbsp;°C and increases as the sun rises until equilibrium is reached.

===Controller===
A ''differential controller''senses temperature differences between water leaving the solar collector and the water in the storage tank near the heat exchanger. The controller starts the pump when the water in the collector is sufficiently about 8–10&nbsp;°C warmer than the water in the tank, and stops it when the temperature difference reaches 3–5&nbsp;°C. This ensures that stored water always gains heat when the pump operates and prevents the pump from excessive cycling on and off. (In direct systems the pump can be triggered with a difference around 4&nbsp;°C because they have no heat exchanger.)

===Tank===
The simplest collector is a water-filled metal tank in a sunny place. The sun heats the tank. This was how the first systems worked.<ref name=""CSC"" /> This setup would be inefficient due to the equilibrium effect: as soon as heating of the tank and water begins, the heat gained is lost to the environment and this continues until the water in the tank reaches ambient temperature. The challenge is to limit the heat loss.
* The storage tank can be situated lower than the collectors, allowing increased freedom in system design and allowing pre-existing storage tanks to be used.
* The storage tank can be hidden from view.
* The storage tank can be placed in conditioned or semi-conditioned space, reducing heat loss.
* Drainback tanks can be used.

====Insulated tank====
ICS or batch collectors reduce heat loss by thermally insulating the tank.<ref name=""C. Marken 2009"">{{cite journal|author=C. Marken |year=2009|title= Solar collectors: Behind the glass|journal=HomePower|volume=133|pages=70–76|url=http://www.homepower.com/articles/solar-collectors-behind-glass}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author1=C.

Smyth |author2=P.C. Eames |author3=B. Norton |year=2006|title= Integrated collector storage solar water heaters|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2004.11.001|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=10|issue=6|pages=503}}</ref> The other walls of the box are thermally insulated, reducing convection and radiation.<ref name=r1/> The box can also have a reflective surface on the inside. This reflects heat lost from the tank back towards the tank. In a simple way one could consider an ICS solar water heater as a water tank that has been enclosed in a type of 'oven' that retains heat from the sun as well as heat of the water in the tank. Using a box does not eliminate heat loss from the tank to the environment, but it largely reduces this loss.

Standard ICS collectors have a characteristic that strongly limits the efficiency of the collector: a small surface-to-volume ratio.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Y. Tripanagnostopoulos |author2=M. Souliotis |author3=T. Nousia |doi=10.1016/S0960-1481(98)00248-1|title=Solar ICS systems with two cylindrical storage tanks|year=1999|journal=Renewable Energy|volume=16|pages=665}}</ref> Since the amount of heat that a tank can absorb from the sun is largely dependent on the surface of the tank directly exposed to the sun, it follows that the surface  size defines the degree to which the water can be heated by the sun. Cylindrical objects such as the tank in an ICS collector have an inherently  small surface-to-volume ratio. Collectors attempt to increase this ratio for efficient warming of the water. Variations on this basic design include collectors that combine smaller water containers and evacuated glass tube technology, a type of ICS system known as an Evacuated Tube Batch (ETB) collector.<ref name=""C. Marken 2009""/>

==Applications==

===Evacuated tube===

ETSCs can be more useful than other solar collectors during winter season. ETCs can be used for heating and cooling purposes in industries like pharmaceutical and drug, paper, leather and textile and also for residential houses, hospitals nursing home, hotels swimming pool etc.

An ETC can operate at a range of temperatures from medium to high for solar hot water, swimming pool, air conditioning and solar cooker.

ETCs higher temperature (up to {{convert|200|C|F}}) making them suitable for industrial applications such as steam generation, heat engine and solar drying.

===Swimming pools===

[[Swimming pool#Covers|Floating pool covering systems]] and separate STCs are used for pool heating.

Pool covering systems, whether solid sheets or floating disks, act as insulation and reduce heat loss. Much heat loss occurs through evaporation, and using a cover slows evaporation.

STCs for nonpotable pool water use are often made of plastic. [[Swimming pool|Pool]] water is mildly corrosive due to chlorine. Water is circulated through the panels using the existing pool filter or supplemental pump. In mild environments, unglazed plastic collectors are more efficient as a direct system. In cold or windy environments evacuated tubes or flat plates in an indirect configuration are used in conjunction with a heat exchanger. This reduces corrosion. A fairly simple [[#Active systems with intelligent controllers|differential temperature controller]] is used to direct the water to the panels or heat exchanger either by turning a valve or operating the pump. Once the pool water has reached the required temperature, a diverter valve is used to return water directly to the pool without heating.<ref name=""D. Lane 2003"">{{cite journal|author=D. Lane|year=2003|title= Solar pool heating basics, Part 2|journal=HomePower |volume=95|pages=60–67}}</ref> Many systems are configured as drainback systems where the water drains into the pool when the water pump is switched off.

The collector panels are usually mounted on a nearby roof, or ground-mounted on a tilted rack. Due to the low temperature difference between the air and the water, the panels are often formed collectors or unglazed flat plate collectors. A simple rule-of-thumb for the required panel area needed is 50%  of the pool's surface area.<ref name=""D. Lane 2003""/> This is for areas where pools are used in the summer season only. Adding solar collectors to a conventional outdoor pool, in a cold climate, can typically extend the pool's comfortable usage by months and more if an insulating pool cover is used.<ref name=LanePt1/> An [[active solar]] energy system analysis program may be used to optimize the solar pool heating system before it is built.

==Energy production==
[[Image:Laundromat-SolarCell.png|thumb|A laundromat in [[California]] with panels on the roof providing hot washing water.]]

The amount of heat delivered by a solar water heating system depends primarily on the amount of heat delivered by the sun at a particular place ([[insolation]]). In the tropics insolation can be relatively high, e.g. 7&nbsp;kWh/m2 per day, versus e.g., 3.2&nbsp;kWh/m2 per day in [[temperate]] areas. Even at the same latitude average insolation can vary a great deal from location to location due to differences in local weather patterns and the amount of overcast. Calculators are available for estimating [[insolation]] at a site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sunbird.jrc.it/pvgis/imaps |title=interactive maps |publisher=Sunbird.jrc.it |date=30 October 2008 |accessdate=10 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/calculators/PVWATTS/version1/ |title=A Performance Calculator for Grid-Connected PV Systems |publisher=Rredc.nrel.gov |accessdate=10 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118101606/http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/calculators/PVWATTS/version1/ |archivedate=January 18, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov |title=National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Home Page |publisher=Nrel.gov |date=6 February 2012 |accessdate=10 February 2012}}</ref>

Below is a table that gives a rough indication of the specifications and energy that could be expected from a solar water heating system involving some 2 m<sup>2</sup> of absorber area of the collector, demonstrating two evacuated tube and three flat plate solar water heating systems. Certification information or figures calculated from those data are used. The bottom two rows give estimates for daily energy production (kWh/day) for a tropical and a [[temperate]] scenario. These estimates are for heating water to 50&nbsp;°C above ambient temperature.

With most solar water heating systems, the energy output scales linearly with the collector surface area.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070220142041/http://www.solar-rating.org/certification/certification.htm SRCC Certification Programs]. solar-rating.org</ref>

The figures are fairly similar between the above collectors, yielding some 4&nbsp;kWh/day in a temperate climate and some 8&nbsp;kWh/day in a tropical climate when using a collector with a 2 m<sup>2</sup> absorber. In the [[temperate]] scenario this is sufficient to heat 200 litres of water by some 17&nbsp;°C. In the tropical scenario the equivalent heating would be by some 33&nbsp;°C. Many thermosiphon systems have comparable energy output to equivalent active systems. The efficiency of evacuated tube collectors is somewhat lower than for flat plate collectors because the absorbers are narrower than the tubes and the tubes have space between them, resulting in a significantly larger percentage of inactive overall collector area. Some methods of comparison<ref>ISO 9806-2:1995. Test methods for solar collectors – Part 2: Qualification test procedures. International Organization for Standardization, Geneva, Switzerland</ref> calculate the efficiency of evacuated tube collectors based on the actual absorber area and not on the 'space occupied as has been done in the above table. Efficiency is reduced at higher temperatures.

==Costs==
In sunny, warm locations, where freeze protection is not necessary, an ICS (batch type) solar water heater can be cost effective.<ref name=r1>{{cite journal|author1=M. Souliotis |author2=S. Kalogirou |author3=Y. Tripanagnostopoulos |doi=10.1016/j.renene.2008.09.007|title=Modelling of an ICS solar water heater using artificial neural networks and TRNSYS|year=2009|journal=Renewable Energy|volume=34|issue=5|pages=1333}}</ref>
In higher latitudes, design requirements for cold weather add to system complexity and cost.
This increases ''initial'' costs, but not life-cycle costs. The biggest single consideration is therefore the large initial financial outlay of solar water heating systems.<ref>{{cite journal|author=H. M. Healey|year=2007|title= Economics of Solar|journal=Cogeneration & Distributed Generation Journal|volume =22|pages=35–49|doi=10.1080/15453660709509122|issue=3}}</ref> Offsetting this expense can take years.<ref name=""H.

The payback period is longer in temperate environments.<ref name=Marken>{{cite journal|author1=C. Marken |author2=J. Sanchez |year=2008|title= PV vs. Solar Water Heating: Simple Solar Payback|journal=HomePower|volume= 127|pages=40–45|url=http://www.homepower.com/articles/pv-vs-solar-water-heating}}</ref>
Since solar energy is free, operating costs are small.
At higher latitudes, solar heaters may be less effective due to lower insolation, possibly requiring larger and/or dual-heating systems.<ref name=Marken/> In some countries government incentives can be significant.

Cost factors (positive and negative) include:
* Price of solar water heater (more complex systems are more expensive)
* Efficiency
* Installation cost
* Electricity used for pumping
* Price of water heating fuel (e.g. gas or electricity) saved per kWh
* Amount of water heating fuel used
* Initial and/or recurring government subsidy
* Maintenance cost (e.g. antifreeze or pump replacements)
* Savings in maintenance of conventional (electric/gas/oil) water heating system

Payback times can vary greatly due to regional sun, extra cost due to frost protection needs of collectors, household hot water use etc.
For instance in central and southern Florida the payback period could easily be 7 years or less rather than the 12.6 years indicated on the chart for the U.S.<ref>[http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/consumer/solar_hot_water/homes/calculator/index.htm Simplified Residential Solar Hot Water System Calculator], Florida Solar Energy Center (2007).</ref>

The payback period is shorter given greater insolation. However, even in temperate areas, solar water heating is cost effective. The payback period for photovoltaic systems has historically been much longer.<ref name=Marken/> Costs and payback period are shorter if no complementary/backup system is required.<ref name=""H.

==Energy footprint and life cycle assessment==

===Energy footprint===
The source of electricity in an active SWH system determines the extent to which a system contributes to atmospheric carbon during operation. Active solar thermal systems that use mains electricity to pump the fluid through the panels are called 'low carbon solar'. In most systems the pumping reduces the energy savings by about 8% and the carbon savings of the solar by about 20%.<ref>C. Martin and M. Watson (2001). DTI publication URN 01/1292. London, UK</ref> However, low power pumps operate with 1-20W.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lainginc.itt.com/LG-pump-DC-Solar-Pumps.asp |title=DC Solar Pumps |work=lainginc.itt.com |accessdate=5 November 2010 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119014925/http://lainginc.itt.com/LG-pump-DC-Solar-Pumps.asp |archivedate=January 19, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> Assuming a solar collector panel delivering 4&nbsp;kWh/day and a pump running intermittently from mains electricity for a total of 6 hours during a 12-hour sunny day, the potentially negative effect of such a pump can be reduced to about 3% of the heat produced.

However, PV-powered active solar thermal systems typically use a 5–30 W PV panel and a small, low power [[diaphragm pump]] or [[centrifugal pump]] to circulate the water. This reduces the operational carbon and energy footprint.

Alternative non-electrical pumping systems may employ thermal expansion and phase changes of liquids and gases.

===Life Cycle Energy Assessment===
Recognised standards can be used to deliver robust and quantitative [[life cycle assessment]]s (LCA). LCA considers the financial and environmental costs of acquisition of raw materials, manufacturing, transport, using, servicing and disposal of the equipment. Elements include:
* Financial costs and gains
* Energy consumption
* CO<sub>2</sub> and other emissions
In terms of energy consumption, some 60% goes into the tank, with 30% towards the collector<ref name=""G. Tsilingiridis, G 2004"">{{cite journal|author1=G. Tsilingiridis, G. Martinopoulos  |author2=N. Kyriakis |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.1016/j.renene.2003.12.007|title=Life cycle environmental impact of a thermosyphonic domestic solar hot water system in comparison with electrical and gas water heating|year=2004|journal=Renewable Energy|volume=29|issue=8|pages=1277 }}</ref> (thermosiphon flat plate in this case). In Italy,<ref name=""F. Ardente, G. Beccali 2005"">{{cite journal|author1=F. Ardente |author2=G. Beccali |author3=M. Cellura |doi=10.1016/j.renene.2004.05.006|title=Life cycle assessment of a solar thermal collector: Sensitivity analysis, energy and environmental balances|year=2005|journal=Renewable Energy|volume=30|issue=2|pages=109}}</ref> some 11 giga-joules of electricity are used in producing SWH equipment, with about 35% goes toward the tank, with another 35% towards the collector. The main energy-related impact is emissions. The energy used in manufacturing is recovered within the first 2–3 years of use (in southern Europe).

By contrast the energy payback time in the UK is reported as only 2 years. This figure was for a direct system, retrofitted to an existing water store, PV pumped, freeze tolerant and of 2.8 sqm aperture. For comparison, a PV installation took around 5 years to reach energy payback, according to the same comparative study.<ref>{{cite journal|year=2008|title=Integrated appraisal of micro-generators: Methods and applications|journal=Proceedings of the ICE – Energy|volume=161|issue=2|page=5, Fig. 1|doi=10.1680/ener.2008.161.2.73|author=S.R. Allen, G.P. Hammond, H. Harajli1, C.I. Jones, M.C. McManus and A.B. Winnett}}</ref>

In terms of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, a large fraction of the emissions saved is dependent on the degree to which gas or electricity is used to supplement the sun. Using the Eco-indicator 99 points system as a yardstick (i.e. the yearly environmental load of an average European inhabitant) in Greece,<ref name=""G. Tsilingiridis, G 2004"" /> a purely gas-driven system may have fewer emissions than a solar system. This calculation assumes that the solar system produces about half of the hot water requirements of a household.

A test system in Italy produced about 700&nbsp;kg of CO<sub>2</sub>, considering all the components of manufacture, use and disposal. Maintenance was identified as an emissions-costly activity when the heat transfer fluid (glycol-based) was replaced. However, the emissions cost was recovered within about two years of use of the equipment.<ref name=""F. Ardente, G. Beccali 2005"" />

In Australia, life cycle emissions were also recovered. The tested SWH system had about 20% of the impact of an electrical water heater and half that of a gas water heater.<ref name=""H. Crawford 2003"" />

Analysing their lower impact retrofit freeze-tolerant solar water heating system, Allen ''et al.'' (qv) reported a production CO<sub>2</sub> impact of 337&nbsp;kg, which is around half the environmental impact reported in the Ardente ''et al.'' (qv) study.

==System specification and installation==
* Most SWH installations require backup heating.
* The amount of hot water consumed each day must be replaced and heated. In a solar-only system, consuming a high fraction of the water in the reservoir implies significant reservoir temperature variations. The larger the reservoir the smaller the daily temperature variation.
* SWH systems offer significant [[Economies of scale|scale economies]] in collector and tank costs.<ref name=""G. Tsilingiridis, G 2004""/> Thus the most economically efficient scale meets 100% of the heating needs of the application.
* Direct systems (and some indirect systems using heat exchangers) can be retrofitted to existing stores.
* Equipment components must be insulated to achieve full system benefits. The installation of efficient insulation significantly reduces heat loss.
* The most efficient PV pumps start slowly in low light levels, so they may cause a small amount of unwanted circulation while the collector is cold. The controller must prevent stored hot water from this cooling effect.
* Evacuated tube collector arrays can be adjusted by removing/adding tubes or their heat pipes, allowing customization during/after installation.
* Above 45 degrees latitude, roof mounted sun-facing collectors tend to outproduce wall-mounted collectors. However, arrays of wall-mounted steep collectors can sometimes produce more useful energy because gains in used energy in winter can offset the loss of unused (excess) energy in summer.

13690575,2017-08-24 02:34:00-05,Solar power,"'''Solar power''' is the [[energy transformation|conversion of energy]] from [[sunlight]] into [[electricity]], either directly using [[photovoltaics]] (PV), indirectly using [[concentrated solar power]], or a combination. Concentrated solar power systems use [[lens (optics)|lens]]es or [[mirrors]] and [[solar tracking|tracking systems]] to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Photovoltaic cells convert light into an [[electric current]] using the [[photovoltaic effect]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Energy Sources: Solar|url=https://www.energy.gov/energysources/solar.htm|work=Department of Energy|accessdate=19 April 2011}}</ref>

Photovoltaics were initially solely used as a source of [[electricity]] for small and medium-sized applications, from the [[Amorphous silicon#Solar cells|calculator]] powered by a single solar cell to remote homes powered by an [[off-grid]] rooftop PV system. Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s.  The 392&nbsp;MW [[Ivanpah Solar Power Facility|Ivanpah]] installation is the largest concentrating solar power plant in the world, located in the [[Mojave Desert]] of [[California]].

As the cost of solar electricity has fallen, the number of grid-connected [[solar PV systems]] has [[Growth of photovoltaics|grown into the millions]] and utility-scale [[Photovoltaic power station|solar power station]]s with hundreds of megawatts are being built. Solar PV is rapidly becoming an inexpensive, low-carbon technology to harness [[renewable energy]] from the Sun. The current largest photovoltaic power station in the world is the 850&nbsp;MW [[Longyangxia Dam]] Solar Park, in [[Qinghai]], [[China]].

The [[International Energy Agency]] projected in 2014 that under its ""high renewables"" scenario, by 2050, solar photovoltaics and concentrated solar power would contribute about 16 and 11 percent, respectively, of the [[worldwide electricity consumption]], and solar would be the world's largest source of electricity. Most solar installations would be in [[Solar power in China|China]] and [[Solar power in India|India]].<ref name=IEA-roadmap-PV-2014 /> Currently, as of 2016, solar power provides just 1% of total worldwide electricity production but growing 33% per annum.<!-- per WP:CALC figures from table below: 1.05%/0.79% = 1.329 = 33% growth -->

{{TOC limit|3}}

== Mainstream technologies ==

Many industrialized nations have installed significant solar power capacity into their grids to supplement or provide an alternative to [[conventional energy]] sources while an increasing number of less developed nations have turned to solar to reduce dependence on expensive imported fuels ''(see [[solar power by country]])''. Long distance transmission allows remote [[renewable energy]] resources to displace fossil fuel consumption. Solar power plants use one of two technologies:
* [[Photovoltaic]] (PV) [[Photovoltaic systems|systems]] use [[solar panel]]s, either on [[Rooftop photovoltaic power station|rooftops]] or in ground-mounted [[solar farm]]s, converting sunlight directly into electric power.
* [[Concentrated solar power]] (CSP, also known as ""concentrated solar thermal"") plants use [[solar thermal energy]] to make steam, that is thereafter converted into electricity by a turbine.

=== Photovoltaics ===
{{Main article|Photovoltaics}}
[[File:PV-system-schematics-residential-Eng.png|thumb|245px|right|Schematics of a grid-connected residential [[PV power system]]<ref name=""SolarCells_Section10_2"">Solar Cells and their Applications Second Edition, Lewis Fraas, Larry Partain, Wiley, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-470-44633-1}} , Section10.2.</ref>]]

A [[solar cell]], or photovoltaic cell (PV), is a device that converts light into electric current using the [[photovoltaic effect]]. The first solar cell was constructed by [[Charles Fritts]] in the 1880s.<ref>Perlin (1999), p. 147</ref> The German industrialist [[Ernst Werner von Siemens]] was among those who recognized the importance of this discovery.<ref>Perlin (1999), pp. 18–20</ref> In 1931, the German engineer Bruno Lange developed a photo cell using [[silver selenide]] in place of [[copper oxide]],<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9CcDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA41 |title=Magic Plates, Tap Sun For Power|journal=Popular Science |date = June 1931|accessdate=19 April 2011|author1=Corporation|first1=Bonnier}}</ref> although the prototype [[selenium]] cells converted less than 1% of incident light into electricity. Following the work of [[Russell Ohl]] in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, [[Calvin Fuller]] and Daryl Chapin created the [[silicon]] solar cell in 1954.<ref>Perlin (1999), p. 29</ref> These early solar cells cost 286&nbsp;USD/watt and reached efficiencies of 4.5–6%.<ref>Perlin (1999), p. 29–30, 38</ref>

==== Conventional PV systems ====
The array of a [[photovoltaic power system]], or PV system, produces direct current (DC) power which fluctuates with the sunlight's intensity. For practical use this usually requires conversion to certain desired voltages or alternating current (AC), through the use of [[Solar inverter|inverters]].<ref name=""SolarCells_Section10_2"" /> Multiple solar cells are connected inside modules. Modules are wired together to form arrays, then tied to an inverter, which produces power at the desired voltage, and for AC, the desired frequency/phase.<ref name=""SolarCells_Section10_2"" />

Many residential PV systems are connected to the grid wherever available, especially in developed countries with large markets.<ref name=""IEAPVPS2009_Fig3"">{{cite web | url=http://www.iea-pvps.org/index.php?id=92&eID=dam_frontend_push&docID=432 | title=Trends in Photovoltaic Applications Survey report of selected IEA countries between 1992 and 2009, IEA-PVPS | accessdate=8 November 2011}}</ref> In these [[Grid-connected photovoltaic power system|grid-connected PV systems]], use of energy storage is optional. In certain applications such as satellites, lighthouses, or in developing countries, batteries or additional power generators are often added as back-ups. Such [[stand-alone power system]]s permit operations at night and at other times of limited sunlight.

=== Concentrated solar power ===
{{Main article|Concentrated solar power}}
[[Image:Parabolic trough.svg|thumb|upright=0.75|A [[parabolic trough|parabolic collector]] concentrates sunlight onto a tube in its focal point.]]

Concentrated solar power (CSP), also called ""concentrated solar thermal"", uses lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Contrary to photovoltaics – which converts light directly into electricity – CSP uses the heat of the sun's radiation to generate electricity from conventional steam-driven turbines.

A wide range of concentrating technologies exists: among the best known are the [[parabolic trough]], the [[compact linear Fresnel reflector]], the [[Solar thermal energy#Dish designs|Stirling dish]] and the [[solar power tower]]. Various techniques are used to track the sun and focus light. In all of these systems a [[working fluid]] is heated by the concentrated sunlight, and is then used for power generation or energy storage.<ref name=""Martin 2005"">Martin and Goswami (2005), p. 45</ref> Thermal storage efficiently allows up to 24-hour electricity generation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/07/solar-can-be-baseload-spanish-csp-plant-with-storage-produces-electricity-for-24-hours-straight|title=Spanish CSP Plant with Storage Produces Electricity for 24 Hours Straight|author=Stephen Lacey|publisher=}}</ref>

A ''parabolic trough'' consists of a linear parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned along the reflector's focal line. The receiver is a tube positioned right above the middle of the parabolic mirror and is filled with a working fluid. The reflector is made to follow the sun during daylight hours by tracking along a single axis. Parabolic trough systems provide the best land-use factor of any solar technology.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/Concentrated-Solar-Thermal-Power.pdf | title=Concentrated Solar Thermal Power – Now | accessdate=19 August 2008}}</ref> The [[Solar Energy Generating Systems|SEGS]] plants in California and Acciona's [[Nevada Solar One]] near [[Boulder City, Nevada]] are representatives of this technology.<ref name=""SolarPaces 2001""/><ref>

''Compact Linear Fresnel Reflectors'' are CSP-plants which use many thin mirror strips instead of parabolic mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto two tubes with working fluid. This has the advantage that flat mirrors can be used which are much cheaper than parabolic mirrors, and that more reflectors can be placed in the same amount of space, allowing more of the available sunlight to be used. Concentrating linear fresnel reflectors can be used in either large or more compact plants.<ref>

The ''Stirling solar dish'' combines a parabolic concentrating dish with a [[Stirling engine]] which normally drives an electric generator. The advantages of Stirling solar over photovoltaic cells are higher efficiency of converting sunlight into electricity and longer lifetime.
Parabolic dish systems give the highest efficiency among CSP technologies.<ref>

A ''solar power tower'' uses an array of tracking reflectors ([[heliostat]]s) to concentrate light on a central receiver atop a tower. Power towers are more cost effective, offer higher efficiency and better energy storage capability among CSP technologies.<ref name=""SolarPaces 2001""/> The [[PS10 Solar Power Plant]] and [[PS20 solar power plant]] are examples of this technology.

==== Hybrid systems ====

:A hybrid system combines (C)PV and CSP with one another or with other forms of generation such as diesel, wind and [[biogas]]. The combined form of generation may enable the system to modulate power output as a function of demand or at least reduce the fluctuating nature of solar power and the consumption of non renewable fuel. Hybrid systems are most often found on islands.

:; CPV/CSP system
:: A novel solar CPV/CSP hybrid system has been proposed, combining concentrator photovoltaics with the non-PV technology of concentrated solar power, or also known as concentrated solar thermal.<ref>Phys.org [http://phys.org/news/2015-02-solar-cpvcsp-hybrid.html A novel solar CPV/CSP hybrid system proposed], 11 February 2015</ref>
:; [[Combined cycle#Integrated solar combined cycle (ISCC)|ISCC]] system
:: The [[Hassi R'Mel integrated solar combined cycle power station|Hassi R'Mel power station]] in Algeria, is an example of combining CSP with a gas turbine, where a 25-megawatt CSP-[[parabolic trough]] array supplements a much larger 130&nbsp;MW [[combined cycle|combined cycle gas turbine plant]]. Another example is the [[Yazd integrated solar combined cycle power station|Yazd power station]] in Iran.
:; [[Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector|PVT system]]
:: Hybrid PV/T), also known as ''photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collectors'' convert solar radiation into thermal and electrical energy. Such a system combines a solar (PV) module with a [[solar thermal collector]] in a complementary way.
:; [[Concentrated photovoltaics and thermal|CPVT system]]
:: A concentrated photovoltaic thermal hybrid (CPVT) system is similar to a PVT system. It uses [[concentrated photovoltaic]]s (CPV) instead of conventional PV technology, and combines it with a solar thermal collector.
:; [[PV diesel system]]
:: It combines a photovoltaic system with a [[diesel generator]].<ref>{{cite web |title=What Is a Photovoltaic Diesel Hybrid System? |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/blog/post/2014/01/what-is-a-photovoltaic-diesel-hybrid-system |author=Amanda Cain |website=RenewableEnergyWorld.com |date=22 January 2014}}</ref> Combinations with [[Hybrid renewable energy system|other renewables]] are possible and include [[wind turbines]].<ref name=""auto"">{{cite web |url=http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/hybrid-wind-and-solar-electric-systems |title=Hybrid Wind and Solar Electric Systems |publisher= [[United States Department of Energy]] |date=2 July 2012}}</ref>

=== Early days ===

The early development of solar technologies starting in the 1860s was driven by an expectation that coal would soon become scarce. [[Charles Fritts]] installed the world's first rooftop photovoltaic solar array, using 1%-efficient [[selenium]] cells, on a New York City roof in 1884.<ref>[https://cleantechnica.com/2014/12/31/photovoltaic-dreaming-first-attempts-commercializing-pv/ Photograph of the world's first rooftop solar panel in 1884.]</ref> However, development of solar technologies stagnated in the early 20th&nbsp;century in the face of the increasing availability, economy, and utility of coal and [[petroleum]].<ref>Butti and Perlin (1981), p. 63, 77, 101</ref> In 1974 it was estimated that only six private homes in all of North America were entirely heated or cooled by functional solar power systems.<ref>""The Solar Energy Book-Once More."" ''[[Mother Earth News]]'' 31:16–17, Jan. 1975</ref> The [[1973 oil crisis|1973 oil embargo]] and [[1979 energy crisis]] caused a reorganization of energy policies around the world and brought renewed attention to developing solar technologies.<ref>Butti and Perlin (1981), p. 249</ref><ref>Yergin (1991), pp. 634, 653–673</ref> Deployment strategies focused on incentive programs such as the Federal Photovoltaic Utilization Program in the US and the Sunshine Program in Japan. Other efforts included the formation of research facilities in the United States (SERI, now [[NREL]]), Japan ([[New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization|NEDO]]), and Germany ([[Fraunhofer Society|Fraunhofer–ISE]]).<ref>

=== Mid-1990s to early 2010s ===

In the mid-1990s, development of both, residential and commercial [[rooftop solar]] as well as utility-scale [[photovoltaic power station]]s, began to accelerate again due to supply issues with oil and natural gas, [[Kyoto Protocol|global warming concerns]], and the improving economic position of PV relative to other energy technologies.<ref>[http://www.solardev.com/SEIA-lightworld.php Solar: photovoltaic: Lighting Up The World] retrieved 19 May 2009  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813163816/http://www.solardev.com/SEIA-lightworld.php |date=13 August 2010 }}</ref> In the early 2000s, the adoption of [[feed-in tariff]]s—a policy mechanism, that gives renewables priority on the grid and defines a fixed price for the generated electricity—lead to a high level of investment security and to a soaring number of PV deployments in Europe.

=== Concentrating solar power stations ===
{{Main article|List of solar thermal power stations}}

Commercial concentrating solar power (CSP) plants, also called ""solar thermal power stations"", were first developed in the 1980s. The 377&nbsp;MW [[Ivanpah Solar Power Facility]], located in California's Mojave Desert, is the world’s largest solar thermal power plant project.  Other large CSP plants include the [[Solnova Solar Power Station]] (150&nbsp;MW), the [[Andasol solar power station]] (150&nbsp;MW), and [[Extresol Solar Power Station]] (150&nbsp;MW), all in Spain. The principal advantage of CSP is the ability to efficiently add thermal storage, allowing the dispatching of electricity over up to a 24-hour period. Since peak electricity demand typically occurs at about 5&nbsp;pm, many CSP power plants use 3 to 5&nbsp;hours of thermal storage.<ref>[http://www.energex.com.au/sustainability/sustainability-rewards-programs/what-is-peak-demand What is peak demand?], Energex.com.au website.</ref>

Adjusting for inflation, it cost $96 per watt for a solar module in the mid-1970s. Process improvements and a very large boost in production have brought that figure down to 68 cents per watt in February 2016, according to data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-solar-power-buffett-vs-musk/|title=Musk vs. Buffett: The Billionaire Battle to Own the Sun|work=Bloomberg.com}}</ref>  [[Palo Alto]] California signed a wholesale  purchase agreement in 2016 that secured solar power for 3.7 cents per kilowatt-hour.  And in sunny [[Dubai]] large-scale solar generated electricity sold in 2016 for just 2.99 cents per kilowatt-hour -- ""competitive with any form of fossil-based electricity — and cheaper than most.""<ref>[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/these-4-solar-power-stocks-will-leave-fossil-fuels-in-the-dust-2016-07-18?link=MW_popular|title=These 4 solar-power stocks will leave fossil fuels in the dust]</ref>

Photovoltaic systems use no fuel, and modules typically last 25 to 40 years. Thus, capital costs make up most of the cost of solar power.

==== Levelized cost of electricity ====

The PV industry is beginning to adopt [[levelized cost of electricity]] (LCOE) as the unit of cost. The electrical energy generated is sold in units of [[kilowatt-hour]]s (kWh). As a rule of thumb, and depending on the local [[insolation]], 1 watt-peak of installed solar PV capacity generates about 1 to 2&nbsp;kWh of electricity per year. This corresponds to a [[capacity factor]] of around 10–20%. The product of the local cost of electricity and the insolation determines the break even point for solar power. The International Conference on Solar Photovoltaic Investments, organized by [[European Photovoltaic Industry Association|EPIA]], has estimated that PV systems will pay back their investors in 8 to 12 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pvinvestmentconference.org |title=3rd International Conference on Solar Photovoltaic Investments |publisher=Pvinvestmentconference.org |accessdate=19 April 2011}}</ref>  As a result, since 2006 it has been economical for investors to install photovoltaics for free in return for a long term [[power purchase agreement]]. Fifty percent of commercial systems in the United States were installed in this manner in 2007 and over 90% by 2009.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gtmresearch.com/report/solar-power-services-how-ppas-are-changing-the-pv-value-chain | title=Solar Power Services: How PPAs are Changing the PV Value Chain | date=11 February 2008 | accessdate=21 May 2009}}</ref>

[[Shi Zhengrong]] has said that, as of 2012, unsubsidised solar power is already competitive with fossil fuels in India, Hawaii, Italy and Spain. He said ""We are at a tipping point. No longer are renewable power sources like solar and wind a luxury of the rich. They are now starting to compete in the real world without subsidies"". ""Solar power will be able to compete without subsidies against conventional power sources in half the world by 2015"".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/Story/story/print?guid=F4031B1C-52B9-11E1-A6A2-002128040CF6 |title=China’s visible solar power success |author=Mark Clifford  |date=8 February 2012 |work=MarketWatch }}</ref>

==== Current installation prices ====

In its 2014 edition of the ''Technology Roadmap: Solar Photovoltaic Energy'' report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) published prices for residential, commercial and utility-scale [[PV system]]s for eight major markets as of 2013 ''(see table below)''.<ref name=IEA-roadmap-PV-2014 /> However, DOE's [[SVTC Technologies#The SunShot Initiative|SunShot Initiative]] has reported much lower U.S. installation prices.

=== Grid parity ===
{{main article|Grid parity}}

Grid parity, the point at which the cost of photovoltaic electricity is equal to or cheaper than the price of [[Mains electricity|grid power]], is more easily achieved in areas with abundant sun and high costs for electricity such as in [[California]] and [[Japan]].<ref>[http://www.bp.com/genericarticle.do?categoryId=9013609&contentId=7005395 Going for grid parity] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608081013/http://www.bp.com/genericarticle.do?categoryId=9013609&contentId=7005395 |date=8 June 2011 }} 2005 article</ref> In 2008, The levelized cost of electricity for solar PV was $0.25/kWh or less in most of the [[OECD]] countries. By late 2011, the fully loaded cost was predicted to fall below $0.15/kWh for most of the [[OECD]] and to reach $0.10/kWh in sunnier regions. These cost levels are driving three emerging trends: vertical integration of the supply chain, origination of [[power purchase agreement]]s (PPAs) by solar power companies, and unexpected risk for traditional power generation companies, [[grid operator]]s and [[wind turbine manufacturer]]s.<ref name=truecost />{{dead link|date = June 2015}}

Grid parity was first reached in [[Spain]] in 2013,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/peterdetwiler/2012/12/26/solar-grid-parity-comes-to-spain/ | title=Solar Grid Parity Comes to Spain | work=Forbes | first=Peter | last=Kelly-Detwiler}}</ref> [[Hawaii]] and other islands that otherwise use [[fossil fuel]] ([[diesel fuel]]) to produce electricity, and most of the US is expected to reach grid parity by 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bp.com/sectiongenericarticle.do?categoryId=9019305&contentId=7035199|title=Gaining on the grid|publisher=BP}}</ref>{{failed verification|date = June 2015}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bp.com/popupimage.do?img_path=liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/frontiers/STAGING/local_assets/images/fr19solar_parity570x417.jpg%20&alt_tag=Graphic%20about%20grid%20parity,%20when%20the%20cost%20of%20solar%20energy%20equals%20that%20of%20grid%20electricity |title=The Path to Grid Parity |publisher=BP |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191313/http://www.bp.com/popupimage.do?img_path=liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/frontiers/STAGING/local_assets/images/fr19solar_parity570x417.jpg%20&alt_tag=Graphic%20about%20grid%20parity,%20when%20the%20cost%20of%20solar%20energy%20equals%20that%20of%20grid%20electricity |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy }}{{failed verification|date = June 2015}}</ref>

===Productivity by location===
{{see also|Solar irradiance}}
The productivity of solar power in a region depends on [[solar irradiance]], which varies through the day and is influenced by [[latitude]] and [[climate]]. 

The locations with highest annual solar irradiance lie in the arid tropics and subtropics. Deserts lying in low latitudes usually have few clouds, and can receive sunshine for more than ten hours a day.<ref>http://slideplayer.com/slide/7652063/25/images/3/Daytime+Cloud+Fraction+Coast+lines+evident.jpg</ref><ref>http://www.econet.org.uk/weather/sun.html</ref> These hot deserts form the ''Global Sun Belt'' circling the world.  This belt consists of extensive swathes of land in [[Northern Africa]], [[Southern Africa]], [[Southwest Asia]], [[Middle East]], and [[Australia]], as well as the much smaller deserts of [[North America|North]] and [[South America]].<ref>http://solarone.me/2016/07/27/living-in-the-sun-belt-the-solar-power-potential-for-the-middle-east/</ref> Africa's eastern [[Sahara|Sahara Desert]], also known as the [[Libyan Desert]], has been observed to be the sunniest place on Earth according to NASA.<ref>http://www.acgeospatial.co.uk/blog/the-cloudiest-place/</ref><ref>https://medium.com/@anttilip/the-sunniest-place-on-earth-in-2016-b56b33172dfc</ref>

=== Self consumption ===

In cases of self consumption of the solar energy, the payback time is calculated based on how much electricity is not purchased from the grid. For example, in Germany, with electricity prices of 0.25 €/kWh and [[insolation]] of 900 kWh/kW, one kWp will save €225 per year, and with an installation cost of 1700 €/KWp the system cost will be returned in less than seven years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Ahl2afL-jL0BdEVGU3dsbllfTzlxMEV0aTNqT0d5Nnc&output=html|title=Money saved by producing electricity from PV and Years for payback|publisher=}}</ref> However, in many cases, the patterns of generation and consumption do not coincide, and some or all of the energy is fed back into the grid. The electricity is sold, and at other times when energy is taken from the grid, electricity is bought. The relative costs and prices obtained affect the economics. In many markets, the price paid for sold PV electricity is significantly lower than the price of bought electricity, which incentivizes self consumption.<ref name=""iea-pvps-trends-2014"">{{cite report |title=Trends in Photovoltaic Applications 2014 |publisher=IEA-PVPS  |date=2014 |url=http://iea-pvps.org/fileadmin/dam/public/report/statistics/IEA_PVPS_Trends_2014_in_PV_Applications_-_lr.pdf}}</ref> Moreover, separate self consumption incentives have been used in e.g. Germany and Italy.<ref name=""iea-pvps-trends-2014""/> Grid interaction regulation has also included limitations of grid feed-in in some regions in Germany with high amounts of installed PV capacity.<ref name=""iea-pvps-trends-2014""/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Stetz |first=T |last2=Marten |first2=F |last3=Braun |first3=M |title=Improved Low Voltage Grid-Integration of Photovoltaic Systems in Germany |journal=IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy  |date=2013 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=534–542 |doi=10.1109/TSTE.2012.2198925}}</ref> By increasing self consumption, the grid feed-in can be limited without curtailment, which wastes electricity.<ref name=""salpakari-lund-2016"">{{cite journal |last=Salpakari |first=Jyri |last2=Lund |first2=Peter |title=Optimal and rule-based control strategies for energy flexibility in buildings with PV |journal=Applied Energy |date=2016 |volume=161 |pages=425–436 |doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.10.036}}</ref>

A good match between generation and consumption is key for high self consumption, and should be considered when deciding where to install solar power and how to dimension the installation. The match can be improved with batteries or controllable electricity consumption.<ref name=""salpakari-lund-2016""/> However, batteries are expensive and profitability may require provision of other services from them besides self consumption increase.<ref name=""rmi-battery-2015"">{{cite report |last=Fiztgerald |first=Garrett |last2=Mandel |first2=James |last3=Morris |first3=Jesse |last4=Touati |first4=Hervé |title=The Economics of Battery Energy Storage |publisher=Rocky Mountain Institute  |date=2015 |url=http://www.rmi.org/Content/Files/RMI-TheEconomicsOfBatteryEnergyStorage-FullReport-FINAL.pdf}}</ref> [[Hot water storage tank]]s with electric heating with heat pumps or resistance heaters can provide low-cost storage for self consumption of solar power.<ref name=""salpakari-lund-2016""/> Shiftable loads, such as dishwashers, tumble dryers and washing machines, can provide controllable consumption with only a limited effect on the users, but their effect on self consumption of solar power may be limited.<ref name=""salpakari-lund-2016""/>

=== Energy pricing and incentives ===
{{Main article|PV financial incentives}}

The political purpose of incentive policies for PV is to facilitate an initial small-scale deployment to begin to grow the industry, even where the cost of PV is significantly above grid parity, to allow the industry to achieve the economies of scale necessary to reach grid parity. The policies are implemented to promote national energy independence, high tech job creation and reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Three incentive mechanisms are often used in combination as investment subsidies: the authorities refund part of the cost of installation of the system, the electricity utility buys PV electricity from the producer under a multiyear contract at a guaranteed rate, and [[Solar Renewable Energy Certificates]] (SRECs)

==== Rebates ====

With investment subsidies, the financial burden falls upon the taxpayer, while with feed-in tariffs the extra cost is distributed across the utilities' customer bases. While the investment subsidy may be simpler to administer, the main argument in favour of feed-in tariffs is the encouragement of quality. Investment subsidies are paid out as a function of the nameplate capacity of the installed system and are independent of its actual power yield over time, thus rewarding the overstatement of power and tolerating poor durability and maintenance. Some electric companies offer rebates to their customers, such as [[Austin Energy]] in [[Texas]], which offers $2.50/watt installed up to $15,000.<ref>[http://www.austinenergy.com/Energy%20Efficiency/Programs/Rebates/Solar%20Rebates/index.htm Solar Rebate Program] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725015516/http://www.austinenergy.com/Energy%20Efficiency/Programs/Rebates/Solar%20Rebates/index.htm |date=25 July 2012 }}</ref>

==== Net metering ====
[[File:Feed-in Tariff meter connections.png|thumb|250px|[[Net metering]], unlike a [[feed-in tariff]], requires only one meter, but it must be bi-directional.]]

In [[net metering]] the price of the electricity produced is the same as the price supplied to the consumer, and the consumer is billed on the difference between production and consumption. Net metering can usually be done with no changes to standard [[electricity meter]]s, which accurately measure power in both directions and automatically report the difference, and because it allows homeowners and businesses to generate electricity at a different time from consumption, effectively using the grid as a giant storage battery. With net metering, deficits are billed each month while surpluses are rolled over to the following month. Best practices call for perpetual roll over of kWh credits.<ref>[http://www.dsireusa.org/solar/solarpolicyguide/?id=17 Net Metering]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021172839/http://www.dsireusa.org/solar/solarpolicyguide/?id=17 |date=21 October 2012 }}</ref> Excess credits upon termination of service are either lost, or paid for at a rate ranging from wholesale to retail rate or above, as can be excess annual credits. In New Jersey, annual excess credits are paid at the wholesale rate, as are left over credits when a customer terminates service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.njcleanenergy.com/renewable-energy/programs/net-metering-and-interconnection|title=Net Metering and Interconnection - NJ OCE Web Site|publisher=}}</ref>

==== Feed-in tariffs (FIT) ====

With [[feed-in tariff]]s, the financial burden falls upon the consumer. They reward the number of kilowatt-hours produced over a long period of time, but because the rate is set by the authorities, it may result in perceived overpayment. The price paid per kilowatt-hour under a feed-in tariff exceeds the price of grid electricity. Net metering refers to the case where the price paid by the utility is the same as the price charged.

The complexity of approvals in California, Spain and Italy has prevented comparable growth to Germany even though the return on investment is better.{{citation needed|date = June 2015}} In some countries, additional incentives are offered for [[Building-integrated photovoltaics|BIPV]] compared to stand alone PV.
* France + EUR 0.16 /kWh (compared to semi-integrated) or + EUR 0.27/kWh (compared to stand alone)
* Italy + EUR 0.04-0.09 kWh
* Germany + EUR 0.05/kWh (facades only)

==== Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) ====

Alternatively, [[Solar Renewable Energy Certificate|SRECs]] allow for a market mechanism to set the price of the solar generated electricity subsity.  In this mechanism, a renewable energy production or consumption target is set, and the utility (more technically the Load Serving Entity) is obliged to purchase renewable energy or face a fine (Alternative Compliance Payment or ACP). The producer is credited for an SREC for every 1,000&nbsp;kWh of electricity produced. If the utility buys this SREC and retires it, they avoid paying the ACP. In principle this system delivers the cheapest renewable energy, since the all solar facilities are eligible and can be installed in the most economic locations.  Uncertainties about the future value of SRECs have led to long-term SREC contract markets to give clarity to their prices and allow solar developers to pre-sell and hedge their credits.

Financial incentives for photovoltaics differ across countries, including [[Solar power in Australia|Australia]], [[Solar power in China|China]],<ref>[http://www.cnbc.com/id/32551044/site/14081545 China Racing Ahead of America in the Drive to Go Solar]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706133417/http://www.cnbc.com/id/32551044/site/14081545 |date=6 July 2013 }}</ref> [[Solar power in Germany|Germany]],<ref name=""German PV market"">{{cite web|url=http://www.solarbuzz.com/FastFactsGermany.htm|title=Power & Energy Technology - IHS Technology|publisher=}}</ref> [[Solar power in Israel|Israel]],<ref>[http://www.eng.shirasol.co.il/Approved-Feed-in-tariff-in-Israel.htm Approved — Feed-in tariff in Israel].</ref> [[Solar power in Japan|Japan]], and the [[Solar power in the United States|United States]] and even across states within the US.

The Japanese government through its [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]] ran a successful programme of subsidies from 1994 to 2003. By the end of 2004, Japan led the world in installed PV capacity with over 1.1&nbsp;[[Gigawatt|GW]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070208104905/http://www.oja-services.nl/iea-pvps/isr/22.htm]</ref>

In 2004, the German government introduced the first large-scale feed-in tariff system, under the [[German Renewable Energy Act]], which resulted in explosive growth of PV installations in Germany. At the outset the FIT was over 3x the retail price or 8x the industrial price. The principle behind the German system is a 20-year flat rate contract. The value of new contracts is programmed to decrease each year, in order to encourage the industry to pass on lower costs to the end users. The programme has been more successful than expected with over 1GW installed in 2006, and political pressure is mounting to decrease the tariff to lessen the future burden on consumers.

Subsequently, [[Solar power in Spain|Spain]], [[Solar power in Italy|Italy]], [[Solar power in Greece|Greece]]—that enjoyed an early success with domestic solar-thermal installations for hot water needs—and [[Solar power in France|France]] introduced feed-in tariffs. None have replicated the programmed decrease of FIT in new contracts though, making the German incentive relatively less and less attractive compared to other countries. The French and Greek FIT offer a high premium (EUR 0.55/kWh) for building integrated systems. California, Greece, France and Italy have 30-50% more insolation than Germany making them financially more attractive. The Greek domestic ""solar roof"" programme (adopted in June 2009 for installations up to 10&nbsp;kW) has internal rates of return of 10-15% at current commercial installation costs, which, furthermore, is tax free.

In 2006 [[Solar power in California|California]] approved the '[[California Solar Initiative]]', offering a choice of investment subsidies or FIT for small and medium systems and a FIT for large systems. The small-system FIT of $0.39 per kWh (far less than EU countries) expires in just 5 years, and the alternate ""EPBB"" residential investment incentive is modest, averaging perhaps 20% of cost. All California incentives are scheduled to decrease in the future depending as a function of the amount of PV capacity installed.

At the end of 2006, the Ontario Power Authority (OPA, Canada) began its Standard Offer Program, a precursor to the [[Green Energy Act 2009|Green Energy Act]], and the first in North America for distributed renewable projects of less than 10&nbsp;MW. The feed-in tariff guaranteed a fixed price of $0.42 CDN per kWh over a period of twenty years. Unlike net metering, all the electricity produced was sold to the OPA at the given rate.

The overwhelming majority of electricity produced worldwide is used immediately, since storage is usually more expensive and because traditional generators can adapt to demand. However both solar power and [[wind power]] are [[variable renewable energy]], meaning that all available output must be taken whenever it is available by moving through [[Electric power transmission|transmission]] lines to ''where it can be used now''. Since solar energy is not available at night, [[energy storage|storing its energy]] is potentially an important issue particularly in off-grid and for future [[100% renewable energy]] scenarios to have continuous electricity availability.<ref>Carr (1976), p. 85</ref>

Solar electricity is inherently variable and predictable by time of day, location, and seasons. In addition solar is intermittent due to day/night cycles and unpredictable weather. How much of a special challenge solar power is in any given electric utility varies significantly. In a [[summer peak]] utility, solar is well matched to daytime cooling demands.  In [[winter peak]] utilities, solar displaces other forms of generation, reducing their [[capacity factor]]s.

In an electricity system without [[grid energy storage]], generation from stored fuels (coal, biomass, natural gas, nuclear) must be go up and down in reaction to the rise and fall of solar electricity (see [[load following power plant]]).  While hydroelectric and natural gas plants can quickly follow solar being intermittent due to the weather, coal, biomass and nuclear plants usually take considerable time to respond to load and can only be scheduled to follow the predictable variation.  Depending on local circumstances, beyond about 20–40% of total generation, grid-connected [[intermittent energy source|intermittent source]]s like solar tend to require investment in some combination of [[Super grid|grid interconnections]], [[Grid energy storage|energy storage]] or [[Energy demand management|demand side management]]. Integrating large amounts of solar power with existing generation equipment has caused issues in some cases. For example, in Germany, California and Hawaii, electricity prices have been known to go negative when solar is generating a lot of power, displacing existing [[baseload]] generation contracts.<ref>http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/california-sun-solar-power-electricity-energy-prices-negative-renewables-green-climate-change-fossil-a7678086.html</ref><ref>https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/plugged-in/3-reasons-hawaii-put-the-brakes-on-solar-and-why-the-same-won-t-happen-in-your-state/</ref>

Conventional hydroelectricity works very well in conjunction with solar power, water can be held back or released from a reservoir behind a dam as required. Where a suitable river is not available, [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] uses solar power to pump water to a high reservoir on sunny days then the energy is recovered at night and in bad weather by releasing water via a hydroelectric plant to a low reservoir where the cycle can begin again.<ref>

[[Concentrated solar power]] plants may use [[thermal energy storage|thermal storage]] to store solar energy, such as in high-temperature molten salts. These salts are an effective storage medium because they are low-cost, have a high specific heat capacity, and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems. This method of energy storage is used, for example, by the [[The Solar Project|Solar Two]] power station, allowing it to store 1.44&nbsp;[[Terajoules|TJ]] in its 68&nbsp;m³ storage tank, enough to provide full output for close to 39 hours, with an efficiency of about 99%.<ref>

In [[Photovoltaic system#Standalone system|stand alone PV systems]] [[rechargeable batteries|batteries]] are traditionally used to store excess electricity. With [[grid-connected photovoltaic power system]], excess electricity can be sent to the [[electrical grid]]. [[Net metering]] and [[feed-in tariff]] programs give these systems a credit for the electricity they produce. This credit offsets electricity provided from the grid when the system cannot meet demand, effectively trading with the grid instead of storing excess electricity.  Credits are normally rolled over from month to month and any remaining surplus settled annually.<ref>

As prices are rapidly declining, PV systems increasingly use rechargeable batteries to store a surplus to be later used at night. [[Grid energy storage#Batteries|Batteries used for grid-storage]] stabilize the [[electrical grid]] by [[Grid energy storage#Load leveling|leveling out peak loads]] usually for several minutes, and in rare cases for hours. In the future, less expensive batteries could play an important role on the electrical grid, as they can charge during periods when generation exceeds demand and feed their stored energy into the grid when demand is higher than generation.

Although not permitted under the US National Electric Code, it is technically possible to have a “[[plug and play]]” PV microinverter.

Common battery technologies used in today's home PV systems include, the [[valve regulated lead-acid battery]]– a modified version of the conventional [[lead–acid battery]], [[nickel–cadmium battery|nickel–cadmium]] and [[Lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion]] batteries. Lead-acid batteries are currently the predominant technology used in small-scale, residential PV systems, due to their high reliability, low self discharge and investment and maintenance costs, despite shorter lifetime and lower energy density. However, lithium-ion batteries have the potential to replace lead-acid batteries in the near future, as they are being intensively developed and lower prices are expected due to [[economies of scale]] provided by large production facilities such as the [[Gigafactory 1]]. In addition, the Li-ion batteries of plug-in [[electric car]]s may serve as a future storage devices in a [[vehicle-to-grid]] system. Since most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time, their batteries could be used to let electricity flow from the car to the power lines and back.

The combination of wind and solar PV has the advantage that the two sources complement each other because the peak operating times for each system occur at different times of the day and year. The power generation of such [[solar hybrid power systems]] is therefore more constant and fluctuates less than each of the two component subsystems.<ref name=""auto""/> Solar power is seasonal, particularly in northern/southern climates, away from the equator, suggesting a need for long term seasonal storage in a medium such as hydrogen or pumped hydroelectric.<ref>[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/aee9/8815cc874423e67af5fd9bf8eac612b56ea6.pdf Seasonal Energy Storage in a Renewable Energy System]</ref> The Institute for Solar Energy Supply Technology of the [[University of Kassel]] pilot-tested a [[virtual power plant|combined power plant]] linking solar, wind, [[biogas]] and [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|hydrostorage]] to provide load-following power from renewable sources.<ref name=""combined_power_plant"">

Unlike [[fossil fuel]] based technologies, solar power does not lead to any harmful emissions during operation, but the production of the panels leads to some amount of pollution.

International publication number WO0042320 [http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?DB=worldwide.espacenet.com&II=0&ND=3&adjacent=true&locale=en_EP&FT=D&date=20000720&CC=WO&NR=0042320A1&KC=A1]</ref> and Louis M. Michaud,<ref>Michaud's U.S. Patent is US 2004/0112055 A1, ""Atmospheric Vortex Engine""</ref> aims to replace large physical chimneys with a [[vortex]] of air created by a shorter, less-expensive structure.
[[Image:Experimental vortex.JPG|right|thumb|An [[Australian]] experimental atmospheric vortex using smoke as the tracer.[[Geoffrey Wickham]] ]]

Michaud's patent claims that the main application is that the air flow through the louvers at the base will drive low-speed air turbines (21), generating twenty percent additional electric power from the heat normally wasted by conventional power plants.  That is, the vortex engine's proposed main application is as a ""[[bottoming cycle]]"" for large power plants that need cooling towers.

The application proposed by Louat in his patent claims is to provide a less-expensive alternative to a physical [[solar updraft tower]].  In this application, the heat is provided by a large area of ground heated by the sun and covered by a transparent surface that traps hot air, in the manner of a [[greenhouse]]. A vortex is created by deflecting vanes set at an angle relative to the tangent of the outer radius of the [[Solar thermal collector|solar collector]]. Louat estimated that the minimum diameter of the solar collector would need to be 44+ metres in order to collect ""useful energy"".  A similar proposal is to eliminate the transparent cover.<ref>[http://vortexengine.ca/ Atmospheric Vortex Engine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This scheme would drive the chimney-vortex with warm seawater or warm air from the ambient surface layer of the earth.  In this application, the application strongly resembles a [[dust devil]] with an air-turbine in the center.

Since 2000, Croatian researcher from the ''Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture'' ([[University of Split]]) such as Ninic and Nizetic also work on this technology, publishing paper<ref>{{cite journal | author=Sandro Nizetic | title=Technical utilisation of convective vortices for carbon-free electricity production: A review | journal=Energy | volume=36 | issue=2 | date=2011 | pages=1236–1242 |doi=10.1016/j.energy.2010.11.021 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036054421000647X }}</ref> and patents.<ref>Ninic Patent is HRP20000385 (A2), published in 2002, title: ""SOLAR POWER PLANT INCLUDING A GRAVITATIONAL AIR VORTEX"" [http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=HR&NR=P20000385A2&KC=A2&FT=D&ND=4&date=20020228&DB=worldwide.espacenet.com&locale=en_EP]</ref><ref>Nizetic Patent is WO2009060245, published in 2009, title: ""SOLAR POWER PLANT WITH SHORT DIFFUSER"" [https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2009060245]</ref>

==Theory of operation==
[[Image:Conceptual vortex engine.jpg|left|thumb|Conceptual illustration of a vortex engine by Louis Michaud. Diameter 200 m (660 ft.) or greater]]

(applicable primarily to the Michaud patent)
[[Image:VortexEngine.gif|thumb|350 px|right|Elevation (side) view of an 80 m-wide (260 ft) vortex engine. It's constructed mostly of [[reinforced concrete]]. (48) is grade level (the surface of the ground).]]
In operation, the vortex [[centripetal force|centripetally expels]] heavier, colder external air (37), and therefore forms a large, low-pressure [[chimney]] of hot air (35).  It uses about twenty percent of a power-plant's waste heat to drive its air motion.  Depending on weather, a large station may create a virtual chimney from 200 m to 15&nbsp;km high, efficiently venting waste power  plant heat into colder upper atmosphere with minimal structure.

The vortex is begun by briefly turning on a diffuse heater (83) and electrically driving the turbines (21) as fans.  This moves mildly heated air into the vortex arena (2).  The air must have only a mild temperature difference because large temperature differences increase mixing 
with cold ambient air and reduce efficiency.  The heat might be from flue gases, turbine exhaust or small natural gas heaters.

The air in the arena rises (35).  This draws more air (33, 34) through directing louvers (3, 5), which cause a vortex to form (35). In the early stages, external airflow (31) is restricted as little as possible by opening external louvers (25).  Most of the heat energy is at first used to start the vortex.

In the next stage of start-up, the heater (83) may be turned off and the turbines (21) by-passed by louvers (25).  At this time, low-temperature heat from an external powerplant drives the updraft and vortex via a conventional crossway cooling tower (61).

As the air leaves the louvers (3, 5) more rapidly, the vortex increases in speed.  The air's momentum causes centrifugal forces on the air in the vortex, which reduce pressure in the vortex, narrowing it further.  Narrowing further increases the vortex speed as [[conservation of momentum]] causes it to spin faster.  The speed of spin is set by the speed of the air leaving louvers (33, 34) and the width of the arena (2).  A wider arena and faster louver speed cause a faster, tighter vortex.

Heated air (33, 34) from the crossway cooling tower (61) enters the concrete vortex arena (2) via two rings of directing louvers (3, 5, height exaggerated for clarity) and rises (35). The upper ring of louvers (5) seals the low-pressure end of the vortex with a thick, relatively high-speed air-curtain (34).  This substantially increases the pressure difference between the base of the vortex (33) and the outside air (31).  In turn, this increases the efficiency of the power turbines (21).

The lower ring of louvers (3) convey large masses of air (33) almost directly into the low-pressure end of the vortex.  The lower ring of louvers (3) are crucial to get high mass flows, because air from them (33) spins more slowly, and thus has lower centripetal forces and a higher pressure at the vortex.

Air-driven turbines (21) in constrictions at the inlet of the cooling tower (61) drive electric motor-generators.  The generators begin to function only in the last stages of start-up, as a strong pressure differential forms between the base of the vortex arena (33) and the outside air (31).  At this time, the bypass louvers (25) are closed.

The wall (1) and bump (85) retain the base of the vortex (35) in ambient winds by shielding the low-velocity air-motion (33) in the base of the arena, and smoothing turbulent airflow.  The height of the wall (1) must be five to thirty times the height of the louvers (3, 5) to retain the vortex in normal wind conditions.

To manage safety and wear of the arena (2), the planned maximum speed of the vortex base (33) is near 3&nbsp;m/s (10&nbsp;ft/s).  The resulting vortex should resemble a large, slow dust-devil of water-mist more than a violent tornado.  In uninhabited areas, faster speeds might be permitted so the vortex can survive in faster ambient winds.

Most of the unnamed numbered items are a system of internal louvers and water pumps to manage air velocities and heating as the engine starts.

==Criticism and history==
In early studies it was not absolutely clear that this could be made workable due to cross-wind disruption of the vortex.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Michaud LM | title=Vortex process for capturing mechanical energy during upward heat-convection in the atmosphere | journal=Applied Energy | volume=62 | issue=4 | date=1999 | pages=241–251 |doi=10.1016/S0306-2619(99)00013-6 |url=http://vortexengine.ca/VPS/VorPro.pdf |format=PDF }}</ref><ref>Michaud LM (2005) {{cite web|url= http://vortexengine.ca/VSC/AVE_WEB.pdf |title=""Atmospheric Vortex Engine"" }}&nbsp;{{small|(198&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}</ref>  This motivated later studies with wind tunnel empirical validation of the CFD model, which conclude, ""The full scale simulations subjected to cross wind show that the power generation capacity is not affected by the cross winds.""

Also, according to Michaud's patent application, the design was initially prototyped with a gasoline-powered 50&nbsp;cm ""fire-swirl"".

Vehicle-to-grid can be used with ''gridable'' vehicles, that is, plug-in electric vehicles (BEV and PHEV), with grid capacity. Since at any given time 95 percent of cars are parked, the batteries in electric vehicles could be used to let electricity flow from the car to the electric distribution network and back. This represents an estimated value to the utilities of up to $4,000 per year per car.<ref name=""future"">{{cite web

==Versions==
{{OR section|date=February 2017}}
V2G is a version of [[battery-to-grid]] power applied to vehicles.<ref name=Kempton2004>{{cite web|url= http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.186.8557&rep=rep1&type=pdf |title=Download Limit Exceeded|work=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu |accessdate=2017-05-20 |doi=10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.12.025 |date=2007-12-08 |author=Willett Kempton}}</ref> There are three main different versions of the vehicle-to-grid concept, all of which involve an onboard battery:

*A [[Petroleum electric hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] or [[Fuel cell vehicle]], which generates power from storable fuel, uses its generator to produce power for a utility at [[Energy demand management|peak]] electricity usage times.  Here the vehicles serve as a [[distributed generation]] system, producing power from conventional [[fossil fuel]]s, biofuels or hydrogen.
*A [[Battery Electric Vehicles|battery-powered]] or [[plug-in hybrid vehicle]] which uses its excess [[rechargeable battery]] capacity to provide power to the electric grid in response to [[peak load]] demands. These vehicles can then be recharged during [[off-peak]] hours at cheaper rates while helping to absorb excess night time generation. Here the vehicles serve as a distributed battery storage system to [[wikt:buffer|buffer]] power.<ref name = ""meregio"" />
*A [[solar vehicle]] which uses its excess charging capacity to provide power to the electric grid when the battery is fully charged. Here the vehicle effectively becomes a small [[renewable energy]] power station. Such systems have been in use since the 1990s and are routinely used in the case of large vehicles, especially [[electric boat|solar-powered boats]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

[[File:Woodgas farm truck.JPG|thumb|A gasifier system on a pickup truck can be used to power the truck and produce electricity]]
It should also be noted that besides vehicles which have an onboard battery, vehicles without a large battery, but which connect to/recharge a battery placed at the house (for example being part of an [[off-the-grid]] electrical system or [[net metering]] system) could in effect form a vehicle-to-grid system. Even a renewable energy source (like [[wood gas]]) could be used.<ref>[http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2010/01/wood-gas-cars.html Dave Nichols using a wood gas generator to power his car and produce electricity when he parks it at his house]</ref>

==Types==

V2G is classified based on the power flow direction: Unidirectional V2G and Bidirectional V2G.<ref>Yong, Jia Ying, et al. ""A review on the state-of-the-art technologies of electric vehicle, its impacts and prospects."" Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 49 (2015): 365-385.</ref><ref>Sortomme, Eric, and Mohamed El-Sharkawi. ""Optimal charging strategies for unidirectional vehicle-to-grid."" Smart Grid, IEEE Transactions on 2.1 (2011): 131-138.</ref>

==Peak load leveling==
The concept allows V2G vehicles to provide power to help balance loads by ""valley filling"" (charging at night when demand is low) and ""peak shaving"" (sending power back to the grid when demand is high, ''see'' [[duck curve]]). Peak load leveling can enable [[electric utility|utilities]] new ways to provide [[regulation service]]s (keeping voltage and frequency stable) and provide [[spinning reserve]]s (meet sudden demands for power). In future development, it has been proposed that such use of electric vehicles could buffer renewable power sources such as [[wind power]], for example, by storing excess energy produced during windy periods and providing it back to the grid during high load periods, thus effectively stabilizing the [[Intermittent power source|intermittency]] of wind power.  Some see this application of vehicle-to-grid technology as a renewable energy approach that can penetrate the baseline electric market.

It has been proposed that [[public utilities]] would not have to build as many [[gas-fired power plant|natural gas or coal-fired power plant]]s to meet [[peak demand]] or as an insurance policy against [[Power outage|blackout]]s<ref name=""woody"">{{cite news

==Carbitrage==
Carbitrage is a [[portmanteau]] of 'car' and '[[arbitrage]]'. When the [[electric utility]] would like to buy power from the V2G network, it holds an [[auction]]. The car owners are able to define the parameters under which they will sell energy from their battery pack. Many factors would be considered when setting minimum sale price including the cost of the secondary fuel in a PHEV and battery cycle wear. When this minimum price is satisfied, it is deemed as meeting carbitrage.<ref name=""Smart_Garage"">{{cite web

may change the economic equation, making it advantageous to use newer high capacity and longer-lived batteries in BEV/PHEVs. These newer batteries can be used in grid load balancing and as a large energy cache for renewable grid resources. Since BEVs can have up to 50&nbsp;kWh worth of battery storage they represent somewhat more than the average home's daily energy demand. Even without a PHEV's gas generation capabilities such a vehicle could be used for emergency power for several days (for example, lighting, home appliances, etc. with combined load of 1&nbsp;kW could be powered for 50 hours). This would be an example of Vehicle-to-home transmission (V2H).  As such they may be seen as a complementary technology for intermittent renewable power resources such as wind or solar electric.

==Future Plans for Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) in various Countries==
A study conducted in 2012 by the Idaho National Laboratory <ref>{{cite web

revealed the following estimations and future plans for V2G in various countries. It is important to note that this is difficult to quantify because the technology is still in its nascent stage, and is therefore difficult to reliably predict adoption of the technology around the world. The following list is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather to give an idea of the scope of development and progress in these areas around the world.

===United States===
Current environmental issues in the US are playing a vital role in the demand for V2G technology. The decrease in costs for implementation of V2G will be directly related to the speed of adoption by consumers. As smart grid rollout continues and the population realizes the lower cost of electric vehicle ownership, demand will increase. Continued V2G testing and the further development of two-way communications standards will offer interoperability across systems. Fleets such as the US Postal Service will be crucial to V2G development. Private grid testing will continue as utilities, automakers, and colleges form partnerships. The University of Delaware has recently signed its first license for V2G testing with Autoport, Inc. They expect that by the second or third quarter of 2011, 100 electric vehicles on the road will be capable of V2G testing (Bryant 2010).

PJM interconnection has envisioned using US Postal Service trucks, school buses and garbage trucks that remain unused overnight for grid connection. This could generate millions of dollars because these companies aid in storing and stabilizing some of the national grid's energy. The US is projected to have one million electric vehicles on the road between 2015 and 2019. Studies indicate that 160 new power plants will need to be built by 2020 to compensate for electric vehicles if integration with the grid does not move forward (ZigBee 2010).

===Japan===
Japan currently is a leader in the electric vehicle industry. This may allow the country to pioneer new V2G technology for the mainstream. In order to meet the 2030 target of 10% of Japan's energy being generated by renewable resources, a cost of $71.1 billion will be required for the upgrades of existing grid infrastructure. The Japanese charging infrastructure market is projected to grow from $118.6 million to $1.2 billion between 2015 and 2020 (ZigBee 2010). Starting in 2012, Nissan plans to bring to market a kit compatible with the LEAF EV that will be able to provide power back into a Japanese home. Currently, there is a prototype being tested in Japan. Average Japanese homes use 10 to 12 KWh/day, and with the LEAF's 24 KWh battery capacity, this kit could potentially provide up to two days of power (Howard 2011). Production in additional markets will follow upon Nissan's ability to properly complete adaptations.

===Denmark===
Denmark currently is a world leader in wind power generation, with 20% of the country's energy coming from wind (there are enough installed turbines to meet up to 40% of the country's energy needs). Initially, Denmark's goal is to replace 10% of all vehicles with PEVs, with an ultimate goal of a complete replacement to follow. The Edison Project implements a new set of goals that will allow enough turbines to be built to accommodate 50% of total power while using V2G to prevent negative impacts to  the grid. Because of the unpredictability of wind, the Edison Project plans to use PEVs while they are plugged into the grid to store additional wind energy that the grid cannot handle. Then, during peak energy use hours, or when the wind is calm, the power stored in these PEVs will be fed back into the grid. To aid in the acceptance of EVs, policies have been enforced that create a tax differential between zero emission cars and traditional automobiles. The Danish PEV market value is expected to grow from $50 to $380 million between 2015 and 2020. PEV developmental progress and advancements pertaining to the use of renewable energy resources will make Denmark a market leader with respect to V2G innovation (ZigBee 2010).

Following the Edison project, the Nikola project was started<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nikola.droppages.com/ |title=Home |publisher=Nikola |access-date=2016-07-12}}</ref> which focused on demonstrating the V2G technology in a lab setting, located at the Risø Campus (DTU). DTU is a partner along with Nuvve and Nissan. The Nikola project is finishing in 2016, and lays the groundwork for Parker, which will use a fleet of EVs to demonstrate the technology in a real-life setting. this project is partnered by [[Technical University of Denmark|DTU]],<ref name=integration>{{cite web |url=http://orbit.dtu.dk/files/101856208/ISGT2014IstanbulNikola_Final.pdf |title=The Nikola project intelligent electric vehicle integration |last1=Andersen |first1=Peter Bach |last2=Marinelli |first2=Mattia |last3=Olesen |first3=Ole Jan |last4=Andersen |first4=Claus Amtrup |last5=Poilasne |first5=Gregory |last6=Christensen |first6=Bjoern |last7=Alm |first7=Ole |publisher=Technical University of Denmark |year=2014 |access-date=2016-07-12}}</ref> [[Insero]], [[Nuvve]], [[Nissan]] and [[Frederiksberg Forsyning]] (Danish DSO in Copenhagen). Besides demonstrating the technology the project also aims to clear the path for V2G-integration with other OEMs as well as calculating the business case for several types of V2G, such as Adaptive charging, overload protection, peak shaving, emergency backup and frequency balancing. the project starts in August 2016 and runs for 2 years. Other notable projects in Denmark are the SEEV4-City Interreg project which will demonstrate V2G in a car sharing fleet in the north harbour of Copenhagen and the ECOGrid 2.0, which will not include EVs but build the aggregator software to fully integrate it into the Danish electricity markets.

===United Kingdom===
The V2G market in the UK will be stimulated by aggressive smart grid and PEV rollouts. Starting in January 2011, programs and strategies to assist in PEV have been implemented. The UK has begun devising strategies to increase the speed of adoption of EVs. This includes providing universal high-speed internet for use with smart grid meters, because most V2G-capable PEVs will not coordinate with the larger grid without it. The ""Electric Delivery Plan for London"" states that by 2015, there will be 500 on-road charging stations; 2,000 stations off-road in car parks; and 22,000 privately owned stations installed. Local grid substations will need to be upgraded for drivers who cannot park on their own property. By 2020 in the UK, there will be a smart meter in every residential home, and about 1.7 million PEVs on the road. The UK's electric vehicle market value is projected to grow from $0.1 to $1.3 billion between 2015 and 2020 (ZigBee 2010).

===South Korea===
South Korea has set a goal that by 2030, 100% of electric customers will be using smart grid technology. Beginning in March 2010, the government will invest $23.3 billion in development and rollout of smart grid technology. Grid revenues are projected to increase from $4.8 to $53.2 million between 2015 and 2020 (ZigBee 2010).

==Current projects==

===University of Delaware===
Dr. Willett Kempton, Dr. Suresh Advani, and Dr. Ajay Prasad are the researchers at the US [[University of Delaware]] who are currently conducting research on the V2G technology, with Dr. Kempton being the lead on the project.  Dr. Kempton has published a number of articles on the technology and the concept, many of which can be found on the V2G project page.<ref name=""V2G""/>  The group is involved in researching the technology itself as well as its performance when used on the grid.  In addition to the technical research, the team has worked with Dr. Meryl Gardner, a Marketing professor in the Alfred Lerner College of Business and Economic at the University of Delaware, to develop marketing strategies for both consumer and corporate fleet adoption <ref name=""Messenger"">{{cite journal

===Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory===
At [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]], Dr. Samveg Saxena currently serves as the project lead for Vehicle-to-Grid Simulator (V2G-Sim).<ref>
{{cite web
 |title=V2G-Sim
 |url=http://v2gsim.lbl.gov/home
 |publisher=Lawrence Berkeley Lab
 |access-date=2016-11-20
 }}
</ref>  V2G-Sim is a simulation platform tool used to model spatial and temporal driving and charging behavior of individual plug-in electric vehicles on the electric grid.  Its models are used to investigate the challenges and opportunities of V2G services, such as modulation of charging time and charging rate for peak [[demand response]] and [[utility frequency]] regulation.  V2G-Sim has also been used to research the potential of plug-in electric vehicles for renewable energy integration.  Preliminary findings using V2G-Sim have shown controlled V2G service can provide peak-shaving and valley-filling services to balance daily electric load and mitigate the [[duck curve]].  On the contrary, uncontrolled vehicle charging was shown to exacerbate the duck curve.

In another research initiative at Lawrence Berkeley Lab using V2G-Sim, V2G services were shown to have minor battery degradation impacts on electric vehicles as compared to cycling losses and calendar aging.<ref>

Assuming daily V2G service from 7PM to 9PM at a charging rate of 1.440&nbsp;kW, the capacity losses of the electric vehicles due to V2G over ten years were 2.68%, 2.66%, and 2.62%.

===Nissan and Enel===
In May 2016, Nissan and [[Enel]] power company announced a collaborative V2G trial project in the United Kingdom, the first of its kind in the country.<ref>

==Completed projects==

=== Edison ===
[[Denmark]]'s Edison project, an abbreviation for 'Electric vehicles in a Distributed and Integrated market using Sustainable energy and Open Networks' was a partially state funded research project on the island of [[Bornholm]] in Eastern Denmark. The consortium of [[IBM]], [[Siemens]] the hardware and software developer EURISCO, Denmark's largest energy company [[DONG Energy]], the regional energy company Østkraft, the [[Technical University of Denmark]] and the Danish Energy Association, explored how to balance the unpredictable electricity loads generated by Denmark's many wind farms, currently generating ~20% of the country's total electricity production, by using electric vehicles (EV) and their accumulators. The aim of the project is to develop infrastructure that enables EVs to intelligently communicate with the grid to determine when charging, and ultimately discharging, can take place.<ref>{{cite web

===Southwest Research Institute===
In 2014, [[Southwest Research Institute]] (SwRI) developed the first vehicle-to-grid aggregation system qualified by the [[Electric Reliability Council of Texas]] (ERCOT). The system allows for owners of electric delivery truck fleets to make money by assisting in managing the grid frequency. When the electric grid frequency drops below 60 Hertz, the system suspends vehicle charging which removes the load on the grid thus allowing the frequency to rise to a normal level. The system is the first of its kind because it operates autonomously.<ref>{{cite web |title=SwRI develops first ERCOT-qualified vehicle-to-grid aggregation system |url=http://www.swri.org/9what/releases/2014/vehicle-to-grid.htm#.VO66HfldWLY |website=Southwest Research Institute |accessdate=2015-02-26}}</ref>

The system was originally developed as part of the Smart Power Infrastructure Demonstration for Energy Reliability and Security (SPIDERS) Phase II program, led by Burns and McDonnell Engineering Company, Inc. The goals of the SPIDERS program are to increase energy security in the event of power loss from a physical or cyber disruption, provide emergency power, and manage the grid more efficiently.<ref>{{cite web|title=SPIDERS: The Smart Power Infrastructure Demonstration for Energy Reliability and Security|url=http://energy.sandia.gov/wp/wp-content/gallery/uploads/SPIDERS_Fact_Sheet_2012-1431P.pdf|publisher=Sandia National Laboratories}}</ref> In November 2012, SwRI was awarded a $7 million contract from the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] to demonstrate the integration of vehicle-to-grid technologies as a source for emergency power at [[Fort Carson]], Colorado.<ref>{{cite web |title=SwRI will participate in a U.S. Army program to demonstrate alternative sources for an emergency electrical power grid |url=http://www.swri.org/9what/releases/2012/army-spiders.htm |website=Southwest Research Institute |accessdate=2015-02-26}}</ref> In 2013, SwRI researchers tested five DC fast-charge stations at the army post.

==Skepticism==
There is some skepticism among experts about the feasibility of V2G. As the New York Times states:

{{cquote|An analyst at the Minneapolis-based utility Xcel Energy, [explained] a ""[[wikt:pie in the sky|pie-in-the-sky]] vision"" for V2G in which a company would offer incentives to its employees to buy plug-in hybrids. The parking lot would be equipped with recharging stations, which could also return power to the grid from the vehicles.<ref name=""NTY""/> }}

In 2007 an [[Environmental Defense]] representative stated: ""It’s hard to take seriously the promises made for plug-in hybrids with {{Convert|30|mi}} all-electric range or any serious V2G application any time soon. It’s still in the science project stage.""<ref name=""NTY""/>

The Vehicle-to-grid  potential of Honda’s full hybrid vehicles is unexplored, but Honda is doubtful of using them to power homes. ""We would not like to see stresses on the battery pack caused by putting it through cycles it wasn’t designed for,"" said a Honda spokesman. ""Instead, they should buy a Honda generator that was made for that purpose.""<ref name=""NTY""/> However, in December 2013, [[Honda]] announced a partnership with the [[University of Delaware]] where they delivered an Accord Hybrid with on-board bidirectional charger to enter into the [[PJM Interconnection]]'s frequency regulation market.<ref>{{cite press release

===Efficiency comparison===
Charging a fairly efficient battery system from the grid is at best 70 to 80% efficient.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  Returning that energy from the battery to the grid, which includes ""inverting"" the DC power back to AC with efficiencies of about 90% yields 63–72% energy return to the system.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}  This needs to be factored against potential cost savings as well as the additional wear and tear on the batteries (current batteries last a few thousand [[Rechargeable battery#Table of rechargeable battery technologies|cycles]] at maximum) and especially increased emissions if the original source of power is fossil based. This cycle of energy efficiency may be compared with the 70–80% efficiency of large-scale location-restricted [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]].<ref>{{cite web

However, pumped storage is limited by geography so it could be practical to take a small amount of energy from a large number of batteries if there are enough PHEV/BEV vehicles on the grid.  1&nbsp;kW from 1000 vehicles is 1 megawatt of power.
